            <from>Mr S G MMUSI (ANC)</from>
            <p>Last week, on 12 September 2012, we commemorated the 35th anniversary of the death of Steve Biko. Biko, the leader of the SA Students' Organisation, Saso, pioneer of the Black Consciousness philosophy and founder of the Black Consciousness Movement in 1969, died in police custody at the age of 30.</p>
            <p>His life and writings influenced and empowered many people, and his slogan, "Black is beautiful", became the inspiration for many. Biko worked throughout his life to empower black people and he was one of South Africa's most influential and prominent anti-apartheid activists. Biko saw the struggle to restore African consciousness as having two stages, psychological liberation and physical liberation. His philosophy that political freedom could only be achieved if blacks stopped feeling inferior to whites is considered by many to be the turning point in the demise of apartheid.</p>
            <p>Former President Nelson Mandela said of Steve Biko that:</p>
            <p>The intervention on the level of consciousness-and consciousness was a key concept in his political approach and vocabulary-was at the essence of Biko's strategic brilliance and understanding.</p>
            <p>Long live the memory of Steve Biko! [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Mr Speaker, I stand before you as a proud DA constituency MP of Mitchells Plain, which is now entirely blue! [Applause] Yesterday, Mr Speaker, the DA took the last remaining ANC wards in Mitchells Plain - including Philippi, Heinz Park, and New Woodlands - with a 52,4% win. This is the very first time that we have won the seat.</p>
            <p>The message, Mr Speaker, is clear today to the ANC that its ungovernability campaign in the Western Cape has backfired. [Applause]. The more they promote ungovernability in the Western Cape, the more votes we get. It's a fairly simple calculation.</p>
            <p>Also, in Ward 13, Polokwane, the DA grew its share of the vote from 4,93% in the 2011 local government election to 17,31% in yesterday's by-election. This is yet another indication that the people of Limpopo are increasingly dismissing the ANC and its looting of state coffers in that province. Also, in Ward 64, Ekurhuleni, we in the DA grew our share of the vote from 3,29% last year, to 14,92% this year. [Applause].</p>
            <p>Members of the ANC across the board, please take note that the people of South Africa want the DA's quality service delivery and good governance, and they do not want the ANC's selfish and corrupt hegemony that caters only for insiders who are part of the tripartite alliance. They want "a better life for all", and they do not want a party interested simply in itself. Thank you. [Time expired.]</p>

            <from>Mr N J J KOORNHOF (Cope)</from>
            <p>Mr Speaker, on Monday South Africans will be celebrating Heritage Day in various ways, emphasising our different cultures. We should all ponder this on the day and try to reach out for those things that are common to us; those things that provide the glue that keeps us together as a nation. We should also try to serve our country better.</p>
            <p>So far 2012 has been a dramatic year. We have had the joy of the Summer Olympics and the sadness of the Marikana massacre.</p>
            <p>A great reminder of what we have achieved as a nation is hearing or singing our national anthem. It is a link with the true story of reconciliation after a difficult past, as this comes together in one beautiful song. Cosatu's attempt to destroy this little bit of magic in South Africa cannot have come at a worse time. Even to suggest that it is time to remove the English and Afrikaans parts of our anthem is insensitive, and the ANC cannot be silent on this issue.</p>
            <p>We, as South Africans, should constantly remind ourselves that reconciliation does not fall from the sky. It involves hard work, constant self-examination by responsible individuals, and a certain collective behaviour. The blatant racism of white against black or vice versa can never be condoned. Let us make a personal effort every day to focus more on our common heritage and work harder towards reconciliation. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hon Speaker, the SA Reserve Bank has unveiled South Africa's new series of banknotes which features the image of Isithwalandwe Nelson Mandela. In the centenary year of the ANC, it is a fitting tribute to Tata Nelson Mandela as an ANC President who became a symbol of our country's struggle for freedom, human rights, and democracy.</p>
            <p>This development signifies the deep gratitude of the South African people for his life spent in service to the country and for the cause of humanity worldwide. It honour an outstanding leader and a patriot. Banknotes are a window on the country as a whole - its people, heritage, and culture.</p>
            <p>Equipped with a unique combination of security features, the new series of banknotes is amongst the best in the world, with enhanced features for the visually impaired, including raised print on both sides. The new banknotes will be the tender of choice in the Southern African Customs Union. Of course, this will help us as South Africa to enhance prospects of robust regional economic integration.

            <from>Mnr P J GROENEWALD (VF Plus)</from>
            <p>Mnr die Speaker, vanoggend is die misdaadstatistieke vir die tydperk 1 April 2011 tot einde Maart 2012 deur die Minister van Polisie bekend gemaak. Daar is oor die algemeen 'n redelike afname, in veral geweldsmisdade, in persentasies. Die VF Plus wil vir daardie lede van die Polisie wat hard werk om misdaad in Suid-Afrika te bekamp, bedank en hulle ook gelukwens.</p>
            <p>Maar, as ek dit s, dan moet ons ook die werklikheid in die o staar, waarvan die eerste is dat daar steeds 15 609 mense is wat in Suid-Afrika gedurende daardie tydperk vermoor is. Dit beteken daar word elke uur twee mense in Suid-Afrika vermoor. As 'n mens kyk na die statistieke oor die afgelope tien jaar, dan was daar 182 935 mense in Suid-Afrika vermoor. Dit is gelykstaande aan al die inwoners van 'n stad soos Klerksdorp in Noordwes, wat oor 'n tydperk van tien jaar uitgemoor word.</p>
            <p>As ons gaan kyk na seksuele misdrywe, was daar in Suid-Afrika 64 514 slagoffers van seksuele misdrywe in een jaar. Dit beteken dat een persoon in Suid-Afrika elke agt minute 'n slagoffer van 'n seksuele misdaad is.</p>
            <p>Ten spyte van hierdie afnames, moet ons onsself nie laat mislei nie: Suid- Afrika bly 'n geweldadige land waar misdaadvlakke te hoog is. Daar moet harder gewerk word om misdadigers te straf, sodat hulle baie duidelik die boodskap kan kry dat misdaad nie in Suid-Afrika betaal nie. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)</p>
            <p>[Mr P J GROENEWALD (FF Plus): Mr Speaker, the Minister of Police released the crime statistics for the period 1 April 2011 to the end of March 2012 this morning. In general, there is a reasonable decrease in percentages, especially with regard to violent crimes. The FF Plus wants to thank and also congratulate those members of the Police who work hard at combating crime in South Africa.</p>
            <p>But, whilst saying this, we also have to face reality, the first of which is that there were still 15 609 people murdered in South Africa during this period. This means that there are two people murdered in South Africa every hour. Looking at the statistics over the past ten years, one will see that there were 182 935 people murdered in South Africa. This is the equivalent of massacring all the residents of a town like Klerksdorp in the North West over a period of ten years.</p>
            <p>Regarding sexual offences, there were 64 514 victims of sexual offences in South Africa in one year. This implies that one person is a victim of a sexual offence in South Africa every eight minutes.</p>
            <p>Despite these decreases, we should not be deceived: South Africa remains a violent country where crime levels are too high. More effort should be put into punishing criminals, in order for them to get the message clearly that crime does not pay in South Africa. I thank you.]</p>

            <p>Mr Speaker, the ANC believes that the provision of social security grants remains a key strategy of addressing the plight of the poor.</p>
            <p>It is thus extremely worrying when applicants for social security grants in the Piet Retief area are expected to queue outside the South African Social Security Agency, Sassa, offices on a busy side road in the sun and in the rain. Those applying for grants are expected to stand outside and receive services through a small window in all weather conditions. In addition, a shortage of staff often results in those applicants who have been queuing an entire day being turned away without being attended to.</p>
            <p>An incident that was also reported was the sad case of an old woman being knocked down by a speeding car while standing in the queue. It is unfortunate that our people have to face such challenges in order to receive the necessary services.</p>
            <p>It is hoped that new offices will be sourced to accommodate those who require Sassa services, so that they can be attended to with dignity and in safe surroundings. I thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Hon Speaker, Ms Pauline Masutle has become the 46th casualty of the Marikana disaster.</p>
            <p>Beyond the praiseworthy wage agreement, a sad story of Marikana is continuing to unfold. It is the story of power at war with powerlessness. It is the story of need competing with greed. It is the story of poverty existing side by side with prosperity. It is the story of a bourgeois democracy confessing its sins and failures. It is the story of political heavyweights who are simultaneously economic mosquito weights. It is the story of buffaloes weighing more than human beings on the scales of African compradors.</p>
            <p>Professor Muxe Nkondo aptly sums up the Marikana disaster, and I quote:</p>
            <p>The mining poor in South Africa lack support for the fundamental functions of a human being. They are less well nourished than their mine- owning counterparts, less healthy, more vulnerable to physical violence and abuse. In a real sense, the mining poor are not full equals under the law. They do not have access to property as their counterparts do, the same capacity to make a contract, the same freedom of association, movement and choice.</p>

            <from>Mr R A P TROLLIP (DA)</from>
            <p>Hon Speaker, the DA notes the spectacular Democratic Alliance Students Organisation, Daso, electoral victory in the SRC election at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University.</p>
            <p>After a year of good student governance under Daso, and the fulfilment of a realistic and coherent electoral manifesto, Daso went into yesterday's election quietly confident that they would be given a renewed mandate to govern the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University SRC. What happened, in fact, was an unprecedented, record "landslide" electoral victory for Daso, which took 16 of the 21 SRC seats. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>This historic victory confirms and reinforces the fact that all voters, including students, yearn for good governance and governability. This is, in fact, also an important rejection of the poor governance and characteristic "ungovernability" of the ANC-aligned South African Students Congress, Sasco.</p>
            <p>What is of grave concern, however, is the undemocratic and thuggish behaviour of Sasco-aligned students who, when they came to learn of their imminent crushing defeat, resorted to switching off the electricity, and invading a voting station and stealing a ballot box, of which the ballots had fortunately already been counted. This behaviour is an ominous portent of things to come in future elections, where the ANC will come under more and more pressure, as shown by the DA's by-election results yesterday.</p>
            <p>This election result is not only a resounding endorsement of the incumbent Daso-led SRC leadership at this university, but also a significant momentum shift for Daso campaigns on all the other tertiary institution campuses across the country.</p>
            <p>In this regard, we also note the biased and spurious reasons for the nonrecognition and nonregistration of Daso on some campuses, such as the University of Fort Hare.</p>

            <p>Hon Speaker, the ANC welcomes the recent launch, by Nestl, of investment projects to the value of R500 million in Babelegi, Hammanskraal. These projects include, amongst other things, the construction of a 16 000 m factory for the manufacturing of cereals. Moreover, the Babelegi investment alone has created over 130 permanent jobs and 300 indirect jobs over a 20-month period during the construction phase. The two new Nestl production sites in Babelegi will be for the manufacturing of the company's breakfast cereals and, in addition, new production lines.</p>
            <p>This undertaking reflects the ANC-led government's resolve to deepen and strengthen the presence of agro-processing in South Africa. This investment thus represents one of the few investment opportunities taken recently in South Africa by a global multinational company in the agro-processing area.</p>
            <p>The ANC applauds the Nestl Group for their show of confidence in the South African economy and for their continuous investment in South Africa. In line with their long-term commitment to business sustainability, growth and economic development, this will add more value and play a significant role in food security in South Africa and the rest of the world.

            <p>Hon Speaker, the IFP uncovered massive fraud in the run- up to the hotly contested by-election in Ward 12, Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal. Our urgent application to have 525 fraudulently registered voters scrapped from the voters' roll was accepted and effected. It appears that students from a nearby FET college were registered and bribed to vote for our opponents, even though some of them lived hundreds of kilometres away in Pongola!</p>
            <p>The Independent Electoral Commission, IEC, has announced that it will launch an internal investigation into the matter. The IFP welcomes the IEC investigation because, quite frankly, we as the IFP are sick and tired of voter fraud.</p>
            <p>With the ANC and National Freedom Party relationship now at a dead end, and with the IFP winning almost all its by-elections in the province, including those wards that were formerly controlled by this alliance, the IFP's opposition is running scared. Desperate to cling to power, they have resorted to registering voters fraudulently in a desperate bid to win the by-election in Nongoma.</p>
            <p>The IEC ruling, and its intent to investigate this matter, vindicate the IFP's concerns over massive voter fraud that is part and parcel of the ANC- NFP political alliance in KwaZulu-Natal. The IFP is committed to free and fair elections, and where we find instances of voter fraud and corruption we will definitely bring them to the attention of the IEC.</p>
            <p>Even in the face of all these actions, the IFP was the clear winner in the by-election yesterday. Our political opponents need to be reminded that a political victory can only be obtained democratically through the ballot box and not through underhanded shenanigans. It is clear that this ...

            <p>Hon Speaker, as members of this House we have all sworn allegiance to the Constitution, that we will uphold the Constitution with all its provisions. We, as Cope, are worried that the events of last Monday suggest that the Constitution is being blatantly abused by the police. They are offending against the Constitution, while we all watch and say nothing!</p>
            <p>About eight provisions of the Constitution have been violated. For example, the Bill of Rights has been violated by the police by their refusal to allow citizens of this country to participate or act in, or attend any gathering that is legal.</p>
            <p>We say that if this House is silent about this flagrant abuse of power by the police - the simple words of the police, refusing to allow a person to participate in any activities - we are, in fact, beginning to go down a slippery path. We are indeed beginning to go down the path of the Mugabe syndrome.</p>
            <p>We, as this House, therefore condemn this behaviour and want to know what the executive is doing about this.</p>

          <speech by="#mrs-f-f-mushwana-anc">
            <from>Mrs F F MUSHWANA (ANC)</from>
            <p>The ANC is committed to supporting the growth of rural market institutions by empowering small farmers to access markets and build links with formal sector value chains.</p>
            <p>Thus the ANC welcomes the recent official launch of Massmart's Ezemvelo, Direct Farm Programme in Tzaneen and Maruleng, with the aim of identifying, developing, and supporting small farmers in order for them to supply Massmart with fresh produce on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p>This programme represents an investment of more than R15 million, and it includes training, mentoring, technical assistance, and establishing essential links with both finance and retail markets.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Massmart has signed a three-year supplier development agreement with NGO TechnoServe SA, which will ultimately link small farmers directly to Massmart stores. This initiative will assist in job creation, whilst also contributing to the economic empowerment of participating farmers.</p>
            <p>The ANC believes that this initiative is in line with its objective to improve the productivity of existing small-scale and subsistence farmers, and to integrate smallholders into formal value chains and link them with markets.</p>

            <from>Mr S C MOTAU (DA)</from>
            <p>Speaker, on Tuesday the Minister of Labour, Mildred Oliphant, reiterated her government's refusal to engage with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, Amcu, claiming that the union was not recognised. In reality, this means that the ANC is continuing to avoid engaging with unions not affiliated to its alliance partner, Cosatu.</p>
            <p>The Minister is clearly willing to risk another Marikana by defending a majoritarian labour regime. To prevent a repeat of the events of Marikana, we need a fair labour regime that includes all unions, not just those politically connected.</p>
            <p>That is why the DA will push very hard for amendments to the Basic Conditions of Employment Act and the Labour Relations Act to bring an end to a virtual monopoly by employers and majoritarian unions.</p>
            <p>Cosatu's stranglehold on government must be broken once and for all. We need labour reform that is aligned to present-day realities. Thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Ms M C C PILANE-MAJAKE (ANC)</from>
            <p>Hon Speaker, when President Zuma recently outlined the very visible - that is, to those who do not purposely turn a blind eye - successes in service delivery by the ANC-led government in just 18 years, much criticism was forthcoming from the opposition.</p>
            <p>Government has made strides in providing basic services that were historically, during the apartheid era, meant for the few from one race. These services are formal housing, clean water and sanitation, roads, electricity to millions of homes, social protection and creating a safety net for millions of South Africans through social grants - and the list goes on.</p>
            <p>This assertion can be backed by solid research, such as that published by the SA Institute of Race Relations between 1996 and 2010, which indicated, for example, that the number of households living in formal houses increased from 5,8 million to 11 million, or by 89,9%. The number of households with access to electricity increased by 127,9% - from 5,2 million to 11,9 million. The number of households with access to piped water increased by 76,6%. Is that not demonstration enough of what the President was alluding to? The ANC will continue to build upon these achievements in order to realise set goals meant to improve the quality of the lives of South Africans.</p>
            <p>In deepening democracy we need, in a credible manner, to understand the role of the opposition - that of monitoring the ruling party to promote accountability. It is also the role of the opposition to provide support with regard to the enhancement of the lives of South Africans. That is instead of engaging in cheap point-scoring and politicking in pursuit of negating the achievements attained by the ANC, enjoyed by ordinary South Africans. I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]</p>

            <from>The MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND LAND REFORM</from>
            <p>Mr Speaker, firstly, let us congratulate the DA on both victories. We are not like them - they always resent the fact we are in the majority in this House, and they don't want to congratulate us! We are in charge of the country - we must thank them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ANC is building a national democratic society in this country. In any social reconstruction there are setbacks. The ANC is under no illusions in that regard. As in any war, you win some battles and you lose some battles, but we are on course to win the war against the legacy of centuries of colonial rule and apartheid. That is the prize. We are not going to be deterred by losing a battle here and there. We are focused on winning the war, and that we are certain we will do. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>Lastly, with regard to Marikana, which keeps coming up, the President has been very clear that we regret all that happened there. However, let me remind you of one thing. When Janusz Walus and Clive Derby-Lewis killed our hero, Chris Hani, our stalwart Walter Sisulu said that the ANC had seen many crises before and had overcome them, and they would even overcome that one. That is what he said, and I repeat today that this is a crisis we regret, but even this we will overcome. Thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Hon Speaker, let me indicate that I would like to respond to four motions, but I will try to stick to the two minutes allocated to each.</p>
            <p>On the matter raised by hon Oriani-Ambrosini, we want to say to him the ANC policy on Tibet is very clear. There is one China, and Tibet is part of China. Any problem that may relate to any part of China must be left to the Chinese people and their government. [Applause.] We, as the ANC, refuse to bantustanise China, in the same way that China refused to recognise the apartheid Bantustans here. We also do not support secession anywhere in the world. Hon Oriani-Ambrosini knows that. And he has a track record by the way - in the early 1990s, before 1994, he was one of those calling for an independent Zulu Kingdom! So, he does have this trend of supporting secessionism.</p>
            <p>That's the ANC's position.</p>
            <p>Hon Speaker, I turn now to the hon member of the DA who was talking about the victory of the Democratic Alliance Students Organisation, Daso. I would have expected something different actually. The hon member stands up and tells us about Daso's programme to transform higher education. It is of no use to come here and simply celebrate the victory of an organisation that has no track record in leading the necessary transformation in our higher education system. [Interjections.] As a Minister I recognise the necessity for organisations to contest elections and for those who win to be recognised, but I will at the same time always ask the question: Where do those organisations stand in relation to transformation? [Interjections.] Daso does not have that record unfortunately. [Interjections.]</p>
            <p>I now turn to the hon member from the IFP, and this is the last but one. I think that as Members of Parliament we have a duty. You are standing up here, hon member, saying that there is alleged corruption and implying that the ANC is involved in that. At the same time, you are saying that the Independent Electoral Commission, IEC, is still going to investigate the matter. But you are already judgemental - that is not what we expect of a hon Member of Parliament! [Applause.] You have to wait for that investigation to take place, because in the end, if there is corruption that we don't know about, we may not know who is actually involved. It may not be the people you are accusing here of being involved. I think it is important for Members of Parliament to respect due processes.</p>

            <p>Hon Speaker, to conclude this matter, I want to say that the member said that what had happened there was a reflection on the ANC-NFP alliance. Amongst other things, he was actually accusing the ANC, amongst others, of corruption.</p>
            <p>I would like to respond to the last statement, which was delivered by an hon member of the DA, and which is about labour relations and the behaviour of government regarding Marikana. Honestly, our Labour Relations Act prescribes procedures, including recognition agreements with the unions. Whilst we, as government, are prepared to engage with all sides in instances where there are conflicts, we cannot, at the same time, act as if there are no recognised majority unions. As the DA, your problem is that you are antimajority because of the fact that the ANC is the majority. You don't want the ANC to win an election. Thank you very much. [Applause.]</p>

          <speech by="#the-speaker">
            <from>The SPEAKER</from>
            <p>Hon members, before I proceed with the Orders of the Day, I wish to go back to the rulings I indicated I was going to make.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday, 12 June 2012, two points of order were put, on which I intended to make my ruling today, which I wanted to do now. However, the relevant members are not in the House today, so I'll have to do so at a later stage.</p>
            <p>However, I do wish to rule on two points of order raised on Tuesday, 21 August 2012, during the debate on the Lonmin tragedy. During that debate hon Kohler-Barnard made the following statement in reference to the Minister of Police: "He is nothing but an empty suit." Hon Kubayi rose on a point of order, asserting that this was unparliamentary, and I undertook to study the Hansard. Having now had an opportunity to do so, I wish to rule as follows.</p>
            <p>The rules governing unparliamentary language are broadly framed in order to allow as much freedom of speech as possible for hon members. However, one established practice also dictates that any statement or remark that impairs a member's dignity or affronts a member's honour must place a curb on freedom of speech.</p>
            <p>In this particular case I find hon Kohler-Barnard's remark does not refer to the personal characteristics of the Minister. Rather, her remark refers to the manner in which the Minister, politically speaking, is perceived to be doing his job as a Minister. As the remark does not constitute an attack on the person of the Minister, it cannot be ruled unparliamentary. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the debate on the Lonmin tragedy, hon Kalyan objected to a statement by hon Van Wyk to the effect that the hon Kohler-Barnard was "a bloodhound" and requested the presiding officer to rule the remark out of order.</p>
            <p>This House has on numerous previous occasions decided that any statement or remark associating a member with an animal or linking animal behaviour or sounds to a member is derogatory, insulting and by its very nature unparliamentary.</p>
            <p>However, it is my considered opinion that applying such a blanket sanction to all references to animals effectively denudes the English language of its nuances, multi-inferences, and inherent capacity to assign more than one meaning to a word or term, depending on the context in which such a word or term was used.</p>
            <p>The term "bloodhound" denotes a specific breed of dog that was exclusively bred to search for its targets by being tenacious and persistent, without ever abandoning the search. [Laughter.] It simply does not understand the concept of giving up. [Laughter.] The argument may be made here, for the purpose of this ruling only, that that is exactly how some members view their role in holding the executive to account: tenacious, persistent and never letting up. [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>The use of the term "bloodhound" by hon Van Wyk must be viewed within the context of the debate in question and the hon member to whom it was directed. Furthermore, taking into account the nuances of the English language, it should also specifically be noted that the hon Van Wyk did not refer to the relevant member as a "dog". I would have ruled that out of order without hesitation. Moreover, regard should also be had for the fact that hon Kohler-Barnard did not raise any objection to the use of the term. In fact, hon Kalyan objected because she originally heard the remark as "black hound" not "bloodhound". Had that been the case, I would have immediately ruled it out of order. [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>Having studied the Hansard, and having regard for the context of the debate and the role of certain members as they perceive the role of the term "bloodhound" in this context, I rule that hon Van Wyk's remark may stand, as it is not unparliamentary. [Applause.]</p>

          <speech by="#the-minister-of-higher-education-and-training">
            <from>The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING</from>
            <p>Hon Speaker, hon members and our special guests in the gallery, it is a great pleasure for me to address this House on the Further Education and Training Colleges Amendment Bill.</p>
            <p>I want to thank the members of the portfolio committee, led by the chairperson, Mr Malale, for their patience and understanding during the public hearings, and also for allowing space to introduce this amendment during this parliamentary cycle.</p>
            <p>Mr Speaker, the Further Education and Training Colleges Amendment Bill is another step towards developing the Higher Education and Training legislative framework into a system that addresses the needs of adult postschool education in a more coherent manner.</p>
            <p>The amendment is in line with the perspectives outlined in the Green Paper for Postschool Education and Training, which seeks to confront the many challenges facing youth and adults postschool, and which includes the necessity to expand postschool provision to improve access, strengthen the institutions to improve quality, and set out a vision for a more articulated and co-ordinated postschool education and training system.</p>
            <p>Hon Speaker and members, the primary aim of this Bill is to do three main things. Firstly, it is to redefine what has normally been referred to as Further Education and Training colleges as vocational colleges, which underlines the necessity to train for the workplace, as well as to train responsible citizens. It also introduces, over and above these vocational colleges, a new college type which transforms Adult Basic Education and Training centres into Community Education and Training colleges. Both these colleges will offer NQF levels 1 to 4, with the FET colleges - the new vocational colleges - offering up to level 5. This is very important in regard to expanding postschool education and training opportunities for our youth and adults.</p>
            <p>This Bill also introduces a very important institute called the South African Institute for Vocational and Continuing Education and Training. The aims of this institute will essentially be, amongst other things, to conduct research, provide support, and facilitate the training of college lecturers. It will also be at the centre of raising quality and the standard of teaching and learning in our FET colleges, now to be known as Vocational Education and Training colleges.</p>
            <p>We believe that an institute of this nature is essential and central in addressing the many weaknesses that we have in our colleges at this time. Such an institute will be made up of both stakeholders, including labour, business and others, and experts who have knowledge of vocational and continuing education and training.</p>
            <p>We are of the view, therefore, that this measure is a very important component of creating this vibrant postschool education and training system. Ordinarily, we would have expected all the parties and all members to support an intervention of this nature, as it is critical in addressing the many problems that we have inherited from the past, as well as in increasing opportunities, especially for those members of our community who were denied such opportunities in the past. Thank you very much.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#mr-m-i-malale">
            <from>Mr M I MALALE</from>
            <p>Hon Deputy Speaker, Ministers and Members of Parliament, the Further Education and Training Colleges Amendment Bill was referred to the committee on 12 June this year. The committee facilitated public hearings and engaged with written submissions by stakeholders, ending that process on 11 September 2012.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the long title and the short title of the Further Education and Training Colleges Act to Continuing Education and Training Act. This amendment is necessary in order to ensure that the message is received that postschool education focuses on all persons outside schools, not necessarily those who are referred to as adults.</p>
            <p>It introduces a new institutional typology of community colleges which encapsulates the function of the current Adult Basic Education and Training, Abet, centres. It is significant to state that this Bill seeks to repeal the Adult Basic Education and Training Act, Act 52 of 2000, effectively encapsulating adult education and training in the postschool education terrain. In this context there is the introduction of the new institutional typology of community colleges to be responsible for functions of the Abet centres and also to create possibilities for a differentiated educational qualification mix.</p>
            <p>The Bill will introduce or establish - to which the hon Minister alluded - the SA Institute for Vocational and Continuing Education and Training, VCET, which will be responsible, among other things, for advising the Minister on matters of VCET; enhancing and developing curricula design; and promoting human capital development in the VCET landscape.</p>
            <p>It further empowers the Minister to intervene in instances of maladministration and financial impropriety by issuing directives for remediation of whatever morass may be occurring in the board. In the case of a recalcitrant board the Minister will be entitled to appoint an administrator who will take over the functions, powers, and responsibilities of the board, which will cease to exist forthwith.</p>
            <p>We have effected amendments to this Bill in regard to the constitution of the board to limit the contours of ministerial discretion and guarantee compositional certainty, without denting the strategic essence of the original Bill as referred.</p>
            <p>I would like to extol all 17 stakeholders who made the effort to give profoundly thoughtful contributions to the process during public participation. These stakeholders include, amongst others, SA Women in Co- operatives; SA National Apex Co-operative ... Sanaco; Adult Learning Network, ALN; Education SA; National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union, Nehawu; and SA Democratic Teachers' Union, Sadtu.</p>
            <p>It would be remiss of me for not highlighting the fact that the DA declined to endorse the Bill, or abstained from endorsing it, because of organisational political considerations. However, those considerations did not inhibit the DA members in the committee from meaningfully and constructively taking part in the deliberations leading to the approval of the Bill by the portfolio committee. Among those considerations is the following: The assignment of FET colleges to the national sphere will divest the DA of administrative control of the FET colleges in the People's Republic of the Western Cape, under the leadership of Madam "Refugee" Zille. [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>But that does not deter me from congratulating Prof Lotriet on her election as the provincial chairperson of the DA in the Free State, because she is a very profound scholar and loyal member of the portfolio committee. She is about to join us, sworn by her contributions in our committee. Thank you very much.</p>
            <p>I must also thank Tata Mpontshane from the IFP and hon Bhanga from Cope for their support. I know that Comrade Bhanga may want to raise the issue of the administrator, thinking that enabling the Minister to appoint the administrator might tamper with academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and scientific research at the institutions. I would like to assure him that that is not possible. Every law that the Minister wants to introduce will have to be approved by him because he is a Member of Parliament. So he is a human guarantee of the impossibility of any intrusion into the affairs of the institutions by the Minister or anybody else. He is the final guarantee, because his party, more than anybody else, seems to love the Constitution of South Africa. The Constitution enshrines and protects those fundamental values that he seems to stand for and that, we would like to say, we will protect at all costs. Thank you very much. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Dr A LOTRIET</from>
            <p>Deputy Speaker, the DA strongly supports the idea that Further Education and Training, FET, colleges should be strengthened and improved and, indeed, that all forms and levels of education should be improved. This includes adult education and training.</p>
            <p>What this Bill aims to do is to amend the Further Education and Training Colleges Act, FETC Act, in order to provide for the inclusion of a second type of institution within the existing legal framework, and that refers to the Community Education and Training colleges, CET colleges.</p>
            <p>The change of FET colleges in terms of this Bill to vocational and continuing education and training colleges, VCET colleges, is an amendment that can be supported, as it does indeed provide more emphasis on the vocational function of these colleges. The change of "further" to "continuing" colleges also makes sense.</p>
            <p>The establishment of the SA Institute for Vocational and Continuing Education and Training can also be seen as a positive step, as such an institute would be able, inter alia, to develop curricula and do research in the field of the college sector. This is something that can only assist in improving the quality of the college sector.</p>
            <p>However, the Bill becomes problematic in the amendments that seek to convert Adult Basic Education and Training centres, Abet centres, into Community Education and Training colleges, CET colleges, because in terms of the amendments these CET colleges will operate within the existing provisions of the FETC Act as amended by this Bill, and the Adult Basic Education and Training Act, AET Act, will be repealed.</p>
            <p>These Abet colleges that have been converted into CET colleges will then be deemed to have been established in terms of the FETC Act. It is also proposed that the governance structures, funding, management, and other related functions of Abet colleges be regulated in terms of the FETC Act.</p>
            <p>This means that in terms of this Bill these Abet centres, to become CET colleges, will now be transferred to the national Department of Higher Education and Training. This was the essence of the 2012 Further Education and Training Colleges Amendment Bill, where FET colleges were transferred from provincial to national level. The DA opposed that Bill.</p>
            <p>The present Bill now proposes the same for Abet centres by repealing the Abet Act. Provinces will thus not be responsible for Abet centres in terms of the Bill. Not only will FET colleges, but also Abet centres, be controlled by the Minister from Pretoria. This means that all power regarding colleges is being centralised by Minister Nzimande.</p>
            <p>The way in which the previous Further Education and Training Colleges Amendment Bill expanded the powers of the Minister regarding staff, strategic plans, funding, councils, languages, and so forth will in terms of this Bill be extended to Abet centres. This is not the solution to the problems experienced in the sector.</p>
            <p>If one has to go by how the department is dealing with the FET colleges now under its control, the prospects do not look very positive. Students have to wait months for the department to release results, and certificates take months and years to be issued. Surely, if you take control of institutions in order to improve the situation, then that is what should happen. We should not be receiving complaints on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>A question also needs to be asked regarding the Abet centres or the proposed CET colleges. To what extent, if at all, will local and provincial government play a role in determining the local and provincial needs in regard to the programme mix and in the governance of these institutions? A further concern regarding this Bill is the constitutional amendment that is required to Schedule 4 Part A of the Constitution. In terms of Schedule 4, education at all levels, excluding tertiary education, is a concurrent national and provincial competence. This, the 18th Constitutional Amendment, has not yet been passed.</p>
            <p>This creates an extremely unsatisfactory situation and a great deal of uncertainty for colleges, as well as for provinces. In fact, we have a situation where we are debating an Amending Bill based on an Act operating without the assumed constitutional amendment having been effected. Therefore, based on the above reasons, the DA cannot support this Bill. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Mr B M BHANGA</from>
            <p>Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Minister, Cope agrees with the principles and objectives of strengthening further education through vocational training, aligning school education with higher education, and building capacity. This is because what we see today is that we have weak Further Education and Training institutions. The elements and the objectives of this Bill attempt to strengthen them. The Green Paper, in particular, elaborates further on the 2030 Vision, in which we want to build a vocational institute that will be able to build that capacity.</p>
            <p>However, the danger that we in South Africa are confronted with is that we are redirecting students to Further Education and Training, but those very same students are not employable! Your intentions are very noble, but, Minister, the problem we are confronted with in this country is the centralisation of authority. We must avoid that. We, as Cope, are concerned that you continuously want to take over control of the running of universities. That was in the first Bill and now it is in this one.</p>
            <p>We do not understand what informs that. We have seen your actions in your term of office. It is like giving a child a machine gun to just shoot everybody and kill universities. We fear that if we give you more power to run these universities, as you intend in your interventions as the Minister, you won't be capable of running and giving advice and capacity to these institutions. What you will do is to put in administrators who will fail, like those at the Walter Sisulu University for Science and Technology, WSU. You will also do what you were trying to do at the Central University of Technology, CUT, where you were dismissed.</p>
            <p>What you know most, and what we even said on Tuesday, is that you will use the authority in this Bill that you are introducing to intervene at the universities and institutions where you seek to intervene, while all these universities are in fact collapsing under your own administrators! You are unable to intervene and help them.</p>
            <p>We believe that this will compromise the academic freedom of the institutions, and in particular as relates to the establishment of this institute. In the powers you want to give yourself you even say in some sentences that if the institute does not follow the instructions and the guidance, you will just disband the board! We do not want that. We need institutions that are properly guided, and institutes that will be able to guide. I therefore agree with the Professor. The Professor has put it like a professor, very nicely, and mentioned the intentions and how we want to see things.</p>

            <p>[Mr Z S MAKHUBELE: Deputy Speaker, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Members of Parliament, hon members, a person cannot begin talking about Further Education and Training, FET, without referring to the expectation of this sector with regard to developing and producing relevant skills and workers who have the abilities for our country.</p>
            <p>I would like to emphasise that our colleges are important institutions that produce low- and medium-level skills. They produce many critical and relevant skills, which are required to grow our economy and to create jobs. Therefore, it is important that we have a recognised institute that will monitor and oversee this sector.</p>
            <p>Subsection 1(d) of the Bill requires of the Minister to establish the SA Institute for Vocational and Continuing Education and Training.</p>
            <p>The SA Institute for Vocational and Continuing Education and Training will be the first of its kind in South Africa. Germany, as one of the leading nations in vocational and technical education, has the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training, which was established in 1970. The success of vocational education and training in Germany is based on high quality vocational research. The institute looks into the anticipated challenges of vocational education and training, stimulates innovation in national and international vocational systems, and develops new, practically oriented solutions for both basic and advanced vocational education and training.</p>
            <p>The institute was able to monitor and identify the requirements for future skills through immediate review. By doing so, the institutes for vocational education and training are able to provide relevant and requisite skills for employment.</p>
            <p>It is correct that our Further Education and Training, FET, sector is weak because in the past it was not taken into consideration. Most of our programmes, particularly the national technical education, Nated, are outdated. There was none that was relevant, for example, skills in the green economy and maritime industry are but a few that I can mention.</p>
            <p>There are challenges with regard to the curriculum, which leads to failure and repetition, a lower standard of training, weak correlation between colleges and employment, correlation of FET with universities, and administrative challenges.</p>
            <p>The other challenge that we have is skills planning because we have not yet been able to identify future skills gaps, therefore we produce graduates who cannot find employment. We should have a committed institute that will monitor the importance of providing vocational education and will intervene in time. This institute must be an institute that will review programmes of vocational and technical education and training time and again to attain the needs required for work.</p>
            <p>The institute will be a professional organisation consisting of members who have capabilities in the area of vocational education and training. It will be the centre of excellence for advanced research and innovation in the FET sector. In addition, it will develop the abilities and skills of the teachers in vocational education and training.</p>
            <p>It is expected that this institute will co-operate with other existing research institutes to avoid duplication of work. Ladies and gentleman, we applaud the department for the giant step that it has taken to establish this institute.]</p>
            <p>What we are saying is that it is not unique for South Africa to have such an institute. I heard hon Bhanga saying that it was like we are giving the Minister all the powers, and that perhaps informed the fact that he is against the institute! He must do further research and he'll understand that it is not just we as a country who are going to be establishing such an institute. Germany, the leading country on issues of vocational education and training, started the same type of institute in 1970.</p>
            <p>And it has proved that it works, because there is professional advice in the sector and you are able to ensure that training institutions and the industry co-operate and say what is needed, which happens to be the upgrading of the skills of those who are being trained, in skills that are needed by the industry. We want to have the same thing done in our own country, so that we don't have graduates who cannot be absorbed because they are still focused on outdated programmes and skills.</p>
            <p>I thank you. [Applause.]</p>

          <speech by="#mr-a-m-mpontshane">
            <from>Mr A M MPONTSHANE</from>
            <p>Thank you, hon Deputy Speaker. Hon Minister, I must hasten to say that there were some constitutional considerations that would have forced us as the IFP to oppose this Bill, but utilitarian factors weighed heavily on our thinking and our caucus reached the conclusion that we must support this piece of legislation. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>This is because, in our thinking, firstly, this Bill seeks to streamline and co-ordinate Further Education and Training, FET, colleges, and create a very necessary institutional framework such as community colleges, which will enable a greater outreach into our communities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is imperative now more than ever that our institutions of higher learning provide students with the necessary and relevant skills required to move from a learning to an employment environment. For this to happen, their curriculum must be relevant, their teachers must be competent, and their institutions must be easily accessible.</p>
            <p>The main questions that remain are: Are these FET colleges performing in respect of their mandates? Are they producing the skills required by the South African economy?</p>
            <p>Youth unemployment continues to climb and shows no signs of slowing down. This, we submit, is a challenge that must be approached from all angles.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, our FET colleges must concentrate on accessibility, right skilling, competent teaching staff, and the promotion of a culture of entrepreneurship amongst their students.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I know, Minister, that you have tried your best when it comes to the Sector Education and Training Authorities, Setas, but we are saying these Setas should be disbanded and the money be given to FET colleges. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]</p>

          <speech by="#ms-n-gina">
            <from>Ms N GINA</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, we, as the ANC, welcome the proposed amendments to the Bill in totality, especially the repeal of the Adult Basic Education and Training Act of 2000. We also welcome the inclusion of the Community Education and Training colleges. It should be clearly noted that the repeal does not mean that adult education has no role in our country - not at all.</p>
            <p>Though the statistics show that there is an improvement in the literacy rate, there are areas where the illiteracy rate is still very high, especially amongst the adults in our country.</p>
            <p>In addition, the study published by Cloete in 2009 revealed that in 2007 there were more than 2,8 million people of between the ages of 18 and 24 who were not employed, who were not in some form of education or training, and who were not severely disabled. Of this number, over 500 000 had primary education, over 508 000 had secondary education that was under Grade 10 and almost a million had Grade 8 or more, but less had Grade 12.</p>
            <p>So, as a country, what is it that we are learning from this? This tells us that we need to broaden the provision of adult education in order to create educational opportunities for these segments of the population with different needs.</p>
            <p>The Adult Basic Education and Training Act, Abet Act, of 2000, as it is in its current form right now, is very limiting and restricting in regard to the provision of Abet education, because it ends at National Qualifications Framework Level 1, which is equivalent to Grade 9. We all know and agree that in our country, when we talk about the Adult Basic Education and Training, Abet, institutions, we realise that they have been found wanting and have been treated almost like stepchildren in our education system. Hence we have these amendments to the Bill to take care of such things. The Abet Act does not cater for those with qualifications above Grade 9, but who have not completed Grade 12, or those who have failed Grade 12 and need to repeat it.</p>
            <p>During the public hearings, stakeholders such as the SA Women in Co- operatives and the SA National Co-operatives proposed the inclusion of an academy or an institution in the proposed community college model that would provide skills training to sustain the co-operatives. This was a clear indication that people yearned for a different sector that would provide for nonformal, informal and formal education and training.</p>
            <p>We, as the ANC, believe then that the conversion of the public adult learning centres into Community Education and Training colleges is a good move, which will broaden the scope of the provision of education and training for all the citizens of our country. We hope that this will, among other things, continue towards addressing the new challenges that our country is facing.</p>
            <p>Hon members, our country is facing a "youth bulge" phenomenon. Economists have argued that the growing youth population could be an important demographic dividend if they are equipped with the right employable and self-employable skills. However, the demographic dividend will happen only if the economically active people are engaged through education, training and employment.</p>
            <p>The National Development Plan: Vision for 2030 is acknowledging that South Africa has failed to reap this demographic dividend by harnessing the potential of the proportionately large cohorts of working-age youth. We have failed because a large cohort of the young people have a low level of education, that is, below Grade 12, and they are neither employed nor in education and training.</p>
            <p>The department has proposed the National Senior Certificate for Adults of the age of 18 and beyond. Research studies show that a significant number of learners are dropping out of the schooling system after Grade 9, which is the last grade of compulsory education. This group of dropouts include those who drop out between Grades 10 and 11, and are not catered for in the current adult education provision. The only alternative for them is the FET colleges. We are saying that is not enough. We need to open more alternatives for such people; hence, we are supporting such amendments to the Bill.</p>
            <p>While the Department of Education has closed down the finishing schools, it has not, however, provided an alternative for those who failed Grade 12 to repeat the grade on a full-time basis, except for writing the supplementary examinations. It is because of the lack of alternatives that South Africa is faced with these challenges.</p>
            <p>I need to caution all of us that if these young people are not provided for, they will find themselves on the road to nowhere. And the danger thereof is that the "youth bulge" will become a demographic bomb, because a large number of frustrated youth are likely to become a potential source of social and political instability.</p>
            <p>It is against this background that the repeal of the Adult Basic Education and Training Act of 2000 is justifiable, and it will pave the way for the broadening of adult education and training through Community Education and Training colleges, and continuing education and training.</p>
            <p>Thus, while we respect the position of the DA, who are rejecting the Bill in its totality and not supporting it, we, as the ANC, will approve the Bill, because it is a step in the right direction in improving the socioeconomic status of South African citizens.</p>
            <p>So, to me it shows clearly that if the DA cannot support such a Bill that is going to create so many ... [Interjections.] I am coming to them, member. So, to me, if we hear the DA claiming that it is taking care of the people out there in our country, but we find it rejecting such a progressive Bill that is going to take care of all those people that are not employed and are lacking skills in our country, it really leaves much to be desired. One asks oneself which people the DA is taking care of!</p>
            <p>I think Cope was also a little bit confused, because hon Bhanga came here and talked more about the higher institutions, the universities. We are still coming to that Bill, Mr Bhanga! However, it is fine to be proactive and ahead of things! I understand, as he was not even part of the deliberations on this Bill when it was discussed in the committee, but he will learn some other time. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>Hon Mpontshane, thank you very much. We know the way you have been active in the committee. We know the support that you have given, and that you have the interests of the people of the country at heart. That is why we have seen in you such a progressive manner of agreeing with and supporting the Bill. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Deputy Speaker, first of all, let me take this opportunity once more to thank the ANC for working very hard in leading the processing of this Bill, as well as for its support and proper grasp of what the intention of this Bill is.</p>
            <p>Ngibonge nakuwe bab'uMpontshane, angazi ibuye ixabanephi thina nawe ngoba uyayibamba lapho kufanele uyibambe khona. Kule ndawana yemfundo, ongathi siyazwana.

            <p>[Thank you, Mr Mpontshane. I don't know why we sometimes view things differently, because when you are given a task you carry it out diligently. With regard to the issue of education, we seem to be on the same page. I wish that it will remain that way because we do what we are doing for our children, but we don't only do it for them, hon Trollip. We also do it for our elderly.</p>
            <p>I want to explain the issue of Adult Basic Education and Training. You don't know what it is. First of all, Adult Basic Education and Training centres operate illegally. Let me say that most of them ...] ... with regard to legislation the Adult Basic Education and Training centres, as things stand now, are only empowered to offer National Qualifications Framework, Level 1, which is far less than Grade 11 or even Grade 10. Grade 7, yes. [Interjections.] Yes. Well, I am Minister of Higher Education and Training, of course! Many of them are actually offering matric programmes and classes. It is illegal, what we are doing, but government has turned a blind eye on this matter because of the need. What this legislation is doing, is correcting that so that these centres are able to offer programmes up to the equivalent of matric without any problems. That is the objective of this legislation.</p>
            <p>The record of Adult Basic Education and Training since 1994 has also not been a good one. Under provinces it has not been a good one. Hence the President's proclamation that these centres should become a national responsibility. That is together with colleges, by the way. The advantage of doing that is that we are better able to align these institutions with the Setas. We are also better able to ensure that programmes offered at these institutions articulate better with universities for those who want to proceed to university after these initial qualifications, which must be recognised by the universities. So that is the logic of the national government. The logic of the national government is not to centralise power.</p>
            <p>Hon member Bhanga, you know, I hate - not you - ex-communists, because they are like ex-smokers! Since when have you abandoned the dictatorship of the proletariat, for instance? [Laughter.] Not so long ago we were arguing the same thing with you. Now you are like an ex-smoker who does not even want to smell a cigarette from somewhere, as if you have never smoked before!</p>
            <p>In fact, if you look at the establishment of the SA Institute for Vocational and Continuing Education and Training, we are deliberately saying that we need experts to come and advise the Minister. These are experts who would come and design appropriate curricula so that these functions would not just be centralised in the departments. It will enable us to bring in a whole range of other people from outside the department, who will add value to the transformation of our college sector. So, where is the centralisation there?</p>
            <p>My worry though, with the DA and Cope, and there is increasingly hardly any difference now, ...</p>
            <p>... siyabona impela ukuthi ingathi lo mshado usondele. [Uhleko.] Bab'uLekota nashiya umshado kwenye indawo ngoba nifuna ukuzogana lana. Siyayibona le ndaba. [Uhleko.] Nifuna Ukuzogana nizoba omakoti bala eNtshonalanga Kapa. [Uhleko.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)</p>
            <p>[... because we can see that this coalition is about to take place. [Laughter.] Mr Lekota, you left your party somewhere because you wanted to belong here. We are aware of that. [Laughter.] You want to belong to the Western Cape.]</p>
            <p>The problem is that you are reducing this to a petty, party-political issue, at the expense of the interests of the youth and the adults of our country. That is why we are talking about centralisation, but you are not looking at all the advantages. Also, do not just come and talk here - judge us by our track record!</p>
            <p>Hon Deputy Speaker, hon Bhanga was, in fact, out of order. This Bill is not about administration. It is about transforming and changing the face of Vocational and Continuing Education and Training in our country.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, you cannot, by the way, use the issue of the fact that certificates in FET colleges have been delayed. This is not a new problem - it goes back to 2007. However, since this department has been created, we have increased the number of certificates that we have released to graduates from the FET colleges. [Applause.] Even with regard to those certificates that we have not released, we have in the meantime, provided students with proof to show that they have actually completed those particular courses to enable them to access employment.</p>
            <p>That is the work of this department, because our interest is in nothing other than empowering the ordinary workers and the poor of this country, not in centralising power in ourselves! So stop playing narrow party- political games and support something that is actually important!</p>
            <p>The last thing, hon Deputy Speaker and hon members, is in regard to the Adult Basic Education and Training centres that we are changing into Community Education and Training colleges. What we are doing is this. At the moment the Abet centres are focusing only on a, e, i, o, u, and doing matric. We are saying that these centres must be community colleges so that they can offer short programmes in fencing or knitting or baking - skills that are actually needed by ordinary people in the communities. [Applause.] We are changing them in order to empower them.</p>
            <p>Ngoba into eniyijahe kakhulu ukuthi niphikise yonke into eyenziwa nguhulumeni nize ningaboni nezinto eziyizidingo kubantu bakithi. Yingakho niyohlala njalo ningapha kule Ndlu ngoba yithi kuphela esaziyo ukuthi yini esiyenzayo. Sibonga kakhulu kuwo wonke amalungu asekele lo Mthethosivivinywa esiwuphasisa namhlanje. Sibonga kakhulu. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)</p>
            <p>[Because what you are very quick to do, is to oppose everything the government is doing and you end up not recognising the needs of our people. That's why you will always remain that side of this House, because we are the ones who know what we are doing. Thank you very much to all the members who are in support of this Bill being passed today. Thank you very much. [Applause.]]</p>

            <from>Mr S E KHOLWANE</from>
            <p>Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Hon members, on 16 May 2012, a request to consider the appointment of council members to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa, Icasa, Council was referred to the committee.</p>
            <p>We invited nominations from the public and 39 people showed a keen interest in serving as Icasa councillors. On 5, 6 and 7 September 2012 we interviewed 15 candidates in order to make sure that we got five candidates as per the requirement of the Icasa Act. Because there are three vacancies in Icasa, we have to submit five names to the Minister, so that the Minister can appoint three out of the five, in terms of the relevant Icasa Act, Act No 13 of 2000. As parties we came to the conclusion that we should recommend the five names to the House for consideration, so that these names can be recommended to the Minister for the appointment of three.</p>
            <p>I must say that as parties on that portfolio committee we all agreed on three names, but I must also indicate that we differed on two names. The names we, as a committee, are recommending to this House for the Minister, of which three must be appointed, are, firstly, Ms Nomvuyiso Batyi; secondly, Mr Khulile Boqwana; thirdly, Ms Nomonde Gongxeka; fourthly, Mr Manyara Rubben Mohlaloga; and lastly, Ms Katharina Gloria Shirley Pillay.</p>
            <p>As I have indicated, there was consensus among the committee members on three of the names, but we could not agree on two of the names. However, I present the five names to the House for consideration, for recommendation to the Minister, in order for him to appoint three, as per the requirement of the Act. Thank you very much.</p>
            <p>There was no debate. Question put: That the House recommends to the Minister of Communications that three of the following candidates be appointed to serve on the Council of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa: Ms Nomvuyiso Batyi, Mr Khulile Boqwana, Ms Nomonde Gongxeka, Mr Manyara Rubben Mohlaloga and Ms Katharina Gloria Shirley Pillay.</p>

            <from>Mr A C STEYN</from>
            <p>Deputy Speaker, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa, Icasa, is frequently criticised for failing to fulfil its mandate of efficiently regulating the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors to ensure affordable, ubiquitous and high-quality communication services to all South Africans.</p>
            <p>It lacks sufficient suitably qualified staff to produce high-calibre, largely technical work promptly. Its council of well-paid full-time councillors is frequently criticised for not adequately providing the regulatory landscape South Africa needs. The council is hindered in its work by not having sufficient councillors with the relevant technical knowledge to properly guide and oversee the work presented to it by an underresourced administration.</p>
            <p>Of the five candidates for the Icasa Council presented to this House today, the DA is of the opinion that two candidates will contribute little of value to accelerating the roll-out of the necessary regulations and monitoring the delivery of services. If this House perpetually appoints people with inappropriate skills and scant experience in the environment in which Icasa operates, we are all complicit in the entity's perpetual inability to deliver. How can we call these entities to account before the National Assembly if we are responsible for the inappropriate skills complement in the first place?</p>
            <p>The candidates the DA opposes are Ms Nomonde Gongxeka and Mr Manyara Mohlaloga, both of whom are currently ANC cadres in government. Ms Gongxeka is with the SABC and Mr Mohlaloga is with the Department of Communications. And we take a dim view of the career trajectory from public servant to oversight body, as it is an indication of ministerial interference in an entity that should be valued for its independence.</p>
            <p>We also maintain that neither of these candidates has the required skills and experience for the job. This is particularly so in the case of Mr Mohlaloga whose career trajectory has been from the ANC Youth League to this House as an MP, and now to the Department of Communications, where his lack of leadership skills led to a delay in the submission of tenders by potential set-top box manufacturers.</p>
            <p>The ANC's hard-line approach to the inclusion of these two candidates, at the expense of far better qualified individuals, clearly points to the fact that the ANC still favours cadre deployment and jobs for pals over service delivery. I thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#mrs-j-d-kilian">
            <from>Mrs J D KILIAN</from>
            <p>Deputy Speaker, Icasa, as a regulator of the telecommunications industry, is one of the most important drivers for economic growth and job creation in our country.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the reality is that the institution has not lived up to expectations. It has been criticised for its tardiness with the finalisation of regulations to promote competition in the market and drive cell phone costs down, ensure access to affordable broadband, and a host of other matters for which the regulator is responsible.</p>
            <p>The council has also been dragged into political controversies in the past. We can all remember the Vodacom listing in 2009, which raised a number of questions regarding the independence of Icasa as the sector regulator. That was when Vodacom exercised its licence rights agreement to unbundle its shares without the involvement of Icasa and the Minister of Communications. There was a prior agreement in place, but at the last minute Cosatu was uncomfortable. They approached the courts and Icasa somersaulted. Clearly, that was a seriously flawed decision by the regulator, which has raised serious questions about its independence.</p>
            <p>South Africa has lost its competitive edge in information and communications technology on the African continent, let alone the rest of the developing world. We can therefore no longer allow them to regard their work as "business as usual". We need dynamic, trustworthy leadership and an Icasa Council that commands respect throughout the industry as an independent body, free from all political and commercial influence, and with the necessary expertise to regulate this sector. An effectively regulated ICT sector could contribute at least 1% to our economic growth.</p>
            <p>Good candidates were nominated. Unfortunately, a disconcerting trend of inbred musical chairs has also emerged, and my colleague has referred to that, with friends and colleagues in state-owned entities nominating each other - no doubt with some influence somewhere behind the scenes of ANC MPs, and even the Minister.</p>
            <p>Consequently, Cope cannot support all five candidates but only three, who were selected on merit. We cannot support the other two, one of whom is in a senior position in the SABC. We believe she should preferably remain there to ensure that the public broadcaster delivers on its mandate. The other candidate, now a chief director in the Department of Communication and a former ANC MP, could not convince us that he had delivered on his current responsibilities in the department. He was responsible for broadcasting digital migration, local content development, set-top box manufacturing support strategy, etc. [Time expired.] We cannot support that, and we believe that the ANC should stop its interference in Icasa and its appointments. Thank you.</p>

            <from>Mr G D SCHNEEMAN</from>
            <p>Deputy Speaker, firstly, I would like to state with regard to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa, Icasa, Council that one of the things that we are aware of is certain skills that are lacking in the council. So, when we conducted the interviews and deliberated on potential names, these were the things that we looked at. There is a lack of skills in the areas of broadcasting, policy and leadership, as well as legal expertise. These five names that have been presented to the House today for approval have these skills. In fact, any of these five candidates would add value to the Icasa Council and would also contribute to strengthening the work of Icasa, and I actually said it could be any of these five candidates.</p>
            <p>I want to address something that has been raised here now, and it is the issue that was raised by the hon Kilian and the hon Steyn about apparent political affiliation. I want to say something, and make it very clear to this House and to those that are watching. In the past, this very portfolio committee actually participated in nominating and recommending candidates for other entities, which fall under the Department of Communications. In particular, I want to mention the SABC Board, where opposition members at that time who were in this House were actually nominated. They were actually nominated. [Interjections.] They were opposition members, they were not objected to by the DA, and they took office. I just want to make it clear that it is factually incorrect to say that the two people in question, who they say are political nominees, are being pushed by a certain political party.</p>
            <p>It is factually incorrect to come here and say that they have no skills and they would make no contribution whatsoever. In fact, they do possess skills and they would make a contribution. They are not political nominees; they were nominated in their own right and in their own capacity for having the requisite skills to make a contribution to a well-functioning and effective Icasa Council.</p>
            <p>I would appeal to the opposition not to use these opportunities to grandstand and try to score political points, but rather to come here to give the actual facts, in this case that all five candidates possess the skills and qualifications. I would appeal to the opposition to change their stance even at this late hour. Thank you very much. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Mr S E KHOLWANE</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, I will present the report, and the rest I will leave to those who like to argue a great deal!</p>
            <p>My duty is to present the report, but I must start by saying that the Minister is in Polokwane addressing the national conference of community broadcasters, and the Deputy Minister is preparing for her wedding this coming weekend. So, clearly, I must account for where they are, because I know where they are.</p>
            <p>On 7 May the Portfolio Committee on Communications had referred to it a request to consider the appointment of one board member in the SABC, after Mr Clifford Motsepe had resigned as a result of his appointment as an MEC in Limpopo. We advertised the vacancy and received 38 nominations. As a committee we short-listed six names. [Interjections.]</p>

            <p>We then conducted interviews on 4 September 2012. After having interviewed all six candidates, we as a committee came to a conclusion on a name this time around, and all parties on the portfolio committee except the DA agreed on this name. The name that we put before this House for recommendation to the President to appoint in the vacancy of Mr Clifford Motsepe, is the name of Ms Noluthando Gosa. We therefore recommend that her name be put before the House so that the President can appoint her in the vacancy that currently exists on the SABC Board. I thank you. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>There was no debate.</p>

          <speech by="#ms-m-r-shinn">
            <from>Ms M R SHINN</from>
            <p>Deputy Speaker, the SA Broadcasting Corporation, the SABC, is in perpetual crisis. Its board, responsible for rooting out the rot and putting the broadcaster on a recovery path, needs appropriately experienced people of considerable backbone, integrity and ability, and with a commitment to hard work. There is no room for passengers or the workshy who cannot pull their weight when the going gets tough, which is the basic environment at the SABC.</p>
            <p>The current board, when viewed as a whole, lacks financial skills. It has an adequate supply of people with media experience, regulatory knowledge, and basic business skills, but there is a gap in finance. The DA objects to Ms Gosa's appointment, in part because she was not the most appropriately qualified candidate we interviewed. For example, a forensic auditor was rejected in her favour. Her expertise is in media and property investment, and I am sure she is valued in that environment.</p>
            <p>Ms Gosa has served on the SABC board before. She was there from 2003 to 2005. She resigned before her term expired, because, she said, she could not tolerate the corruption and inefficiency of the corporation. Well, what has changed? How do we know that she will last the course this time?</p>
            <p>She also told the committee of her close working relationship with the ANC, and wondered aloud whether this could be interpreted as a conflict of interest and bar her from being considered. It seems not. It has proved to be the final stamp of approval by the majority of the committee.</p>
            <p>Besides the skill and corruption woes, the SABC is riddled with political infighting. It does not need an ANC heavyweight on the board. It needs independent minds that are totally focused on turning the SABC into a world- class broadcaster serving the needs of all South Africans. It does not need another ANC pal.</p>
            <p>Continued deployment of inappropriately skilled ANC cadres condemns these state entities to fail repeatedly in respect of delivering on their mandates. And yet this House, by approving these appointments, is supporting this insanity. It is time for hon colleagues to realise that they cannot continue to criticise nonperformance of state entities if they are responsible for choosing inappropriate people to govern them. The DA does not support Ms Gosa's appointment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#mrs-j-d-kilian">
            <from>Mrs J D KILIAN</from>
            <p>Deputy Speaker, Cope will support the nomination contained in the report before us today. We believe that the process was fair, transparent and objective, and it conformed to the law.</p>
            <p>But, unfortunately, the same tendency has emerged in this process, namely that senior state officials in the communications sector as well as in state-owned entities nominated one another and friends to serve on the SABC Board. Another musical chairs exercise.</p>
            <p>This is not ideal, Deputy Speaker. Although it is not in contravention any Act, respectable leaders from all walks of life should be called upon to make a contribution by making themselves available to serve on the SABC Board - people with experience and knowledge of directing institutions so that they achieve service excellence and profitability.</p>
            <p>For as long as the SABC and Independent Communications Authority of SA, Icasa, nominations are regarded as being for the select few with close connections to the ANC, this will unfortunately not happen. We need to ensure that good governance practices are instilled in the SABC.</p>
            <p>However, Cope is satisfied that Ms Gosa will bring quality leadership to the board, after her experience in the National Planning Commission.</p>
            <p>The current reality is, unfortunately, that the SABC has still not overcome its financial woes, and it is still plagued by very serious challenges, including a lack of effective systems to root out fraud and corruption. Due appointment procedures also still seem to remain a challenge.</p>
            <p>An additional and growing concern is political manipulation and interference with the news editorial policy, which leads to the freezing out of opposition parties, in particular Cope. News reporters are indeed complaining about this. This is against the law, and a matter that the board should regard as a high priority.</p>
            <p>Irrespective of party preferences of individual board members and the SABC executive, they have a duty to serve the nation as a whole. By law they are compelled to, and I quote, "ensure plurality of news, views and information. " This is in section 2 of the Broadcasting Act. It must also service the needs of all South Africans. Its news service must be accurate, fair, and impartial -section 6 of the Broadcasting Act. We trust that Ms Gosa will understand that as a board member she is compelled to be committed to the above, and also to the principles of openness and accountability.</p>
            <p>That brings me to the serious financial woes that are still plaguing the SABC. Deputy Speaker, it is completely unacceptable that there is still no bid adjudication committee functioning, three years after the Auditor- General exposed huge losses and financial corruption. This is a weakness that can create further opportunities for tender manipulation and fraud. This is unacceptable, and she must address that. Thank you, Deputy Speaker. [Time expired.]</p>

          <speech by="#mr-g-d-schneemann">
            <from>Mr G D SCHNEEMANN</from>
            <p>Deputy Speaker, there are a couple of things that I would like to raise. Firstly, when we as a committee looked at the current composition of the SABC Board, one of the things that was extremely noticeable was that the current SABC Board is largely male-dominated. So, that is one of the things that we looked at, the issue of gender representivity.</p>
            <p>During the interviews we found that out of the five candidates that we interviewed, Ms Noluthando Gosa was one that came across exceptionally well. In fact, when we sat down as parties initially to discuss possible candidates that we would bring to the National Assembly, all parties mentioned the name of Ms Noluthando Gosa. So I thought that I should just make that clear right now.</p>
            <p>However, Ms Noluthando Gosa is not being nominated only because she is a woman. She is being nominated - we nominated her and I think most of the parties agree, except for the DA, of course - because we agree that she has the qualities and the skills. If we look at her curriculum vitae, she has the necessary degrees in various areas of competency that we are needing in the SABC.</p>
            <p>I think she has also proved herself to be a person of principle. The fact that she resigned from the SABC Board - because, as she told us, she could not tolerate and support the levels of corruption - I think shows that she is a person of principle. She was prepared to give up her position. [Interjections.]</p>
            <p>Also, if she, in fact, does get to serve on the SABC Board, she will bring with her the experience that she gained from having been a serving SABC Board member. She brings an understanding and a knowledge of some of the things that are required.</p>
            <p>Yes, if she is indeed appointed to the board, we would want to encourage her to serve her full term, and to stand by the principles that she has already indicated to us are the reasons why she resigned in the first place.</p>
            <p>I want to say that as a Parliament here, if we all unanimously support the name of Ms Noluthando Gosa, we will be sending out a very clear and serious message about our support for gender representivity in our country.</p>
            <p>I want to make an appeal ... [Interjections.]. No, no, no. I want to make an appeal to the DA at this late stage to change their position and reconsider their opposition to this particular candidate. Thank you very much.</p>
            <p>Question agreed to (Democratic Alliance dissenting).</p>
            <p>Ms Noluthando Gosa accordingly recommended for appointment to the Board of the South African Broadcasting Corporation.</p>

            <from>Mrs Y R BOTHA</from>
            <p>Hon Deputy Speaker, the Central Drug Authority, CDA, is a statutory body established in terms of the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Dependency Act, Act No 20 of 1992, as amended.</p>
            <p>Its functions are to give effect to the National Drug Master Plan, NDMP, in accordance with the guidelines set out therein; advise the Minister on any matter affecting the abuse of drugs referred to the CDA by the Minister for advice; advise the Minister on any matter the CDA considers necessary; and to plan, co-ordinate, and promote measures relating to the prevention and combating of drug abuse and the treatment of persons dependent on drugs in accordance with the NDMP.</p>
            <p>In terms of section 2(3) of the Act, the parliamentary committees for social development in the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces were tasked to short-list and interview candidates, and submit recommendations to the Minister of Social Development for the purpose of appointing suitable candidates to serve on the CDA.</p>
            <p>I now wish to refer to the members of the subcommittee panel. A subcommittee was formed, and it was constituted of eight members - four representative members each of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development and the Select Committee on Social Services. We interviewed 23 candidates - we had short-listed 24 candidates, but one candidate withdrew.</p>
            <p>As a committee, we are unanimously recommending the following candidates: Mr C P Ucko, Prof D Stein, Ms A M Salter, Mr M M Gama, Dr R Eberlein, Mr D Bayever, Dr L Silva, Mr C Mpyane, Dr M Manyedi, Mr J Kruger, Mrs C Du Toit and Mrs S Ndlovu. [Interjections.]</p>
            <p>The portfolio committee recommends that the House, in accordance with the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Dependency Act, agrees that these names should be sent to the Minister for approval. Thank you.</p>
            <p>Declaration of vote:</p>

          <speech by="#mr-m-waters">
            <from>Mr M WATERS</from>
            <p>Deputy Speaker, the DA supports the nomination of the new Central Drug Authority Board, and wishes them all the best in the forthcoming term. I would also like to thank all members on the committee for their co-operation. We have certainly put political differences aside for the betterment of the country.</p>
            <p>The board play an important role in the fight against substance abuse. Apart from advising the Minister on substance abuse matters, they must also ensure that the NDMP is implemented.</p>
            <p>One of the frustrations experienced by the previous board was that many departments that are obliged to submit their own mini-drug master plans, such as the Department of Basic Education, failed to do so on time or failed to do so completely. The board was found to be powerless and toothless in this regard. If departments fail to meet basic deadlines, then the fight against substance abuse is undermined from the very start.</p>
            <p>In addition, the board has consistently submitted their annual reports to Parliament late, resulting in limited oversight. An example is that the board still has not appeared before the portfolio committee to account for last year's annual report.</p>
            <p>The DA has high expectations of the new board and we believe that the mix of academics and activists that have been appointed will take the board and its influence to new heights. Departments that have in the past simply ignored the board will be in for a great wake-up call. We expect the board to be the voice of the voiceless in combating substance abuse, for in failing to do so we will be failing the youth of our country. I thank you very much. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>Question agreed to.</p>

          <heading id="dbsh36">CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2010-11 OF SA SOCIAL SECURITY AGENCY, SASSA</heading>
          <speech by="#mrs-y-r-botha">
            <from>Mrs Y R BOTHA</from>
            <p>Thank you, hon Deputy Speaker. The Portfolio Committee on Social Development deliberated on the 2010-11 annual report of the SA Social Security Agency, Sassa. This report presents some of the key achievements, as well as challenges, encountered by Sassa. The report also highlights matters of concern raised by the committee.</p>
            <p>In regard to the annual report, there were key priorities that were presented to the committee and these were also reflected in the report. They were: customer care-centred benefits administration and management system; improved organisational capacity; comprehensive and integrated social security administration; and management services.</p>
            <p>The agency received an unqualified audit opinion for the year under review, and it had a disclaimer opinion for the 2009-10 financial year. So, there has been a definite improvement.</p>
            <p>In regard to the committee's observations, the committee commended Sassa for the unqualified report.</p>
            <p>However, it drew attention to the Auditor-General's remarks that a number of grant beneficiary files requested when they did the regulatory audit were not presented. Furthermore, numerous files presented by Sassa did not contain the necessary information that is required to form the basis for a valid grant payment.</p>
            <p>The committee further noted with concern the existing dual accountability between the Department of Social Development and Sassa for the flow of funds, which resulted in the department receiving an unqualified audit report in the previous financial year.</p>
            <p>The committee further noted that the department would strengthen its oversight over Sassa by developing an internal audit process and financial inspections. This is critical to ensure that the department strengthens its governance over its entities.</p>
            <p>We expressed our satisfaction with the improvement of Sassa's audit report, from the disclaimer to a qualified audit opinion.</p>
            <p>We therefore recommend that the issue of dual accountability between the Department of Social Development and the SA Social Security Agency should be addressed, so as to clarify the problem of accountability for the flow of funds.</p>
            <p>The audit committees of the department and Sassa should meet on a regular basis to monitor and review internal control and systems, and recommend improvements with regard to them.</p>
            <p>The department and Sassa should also ensure that there is a skills transfer from contractors to Sassa employees, so that there will be sustained effective functioning of Sassa.</p>
            <p>We also noted that Sassa has been paying the Special Investigation Unit, SIU, R3 million monthly since its inception to conduct investigations on fraud and corruption with regard to social grants. This is very costly and the committee therefore recommends that the department should fast-track and finalise the establishment of an inspectorate for social assistance that is provided for in the Social Assistance Act, Act 13 of 2004, so that Sassa can conduct its own investigations to save costs.</p>

          <speech by="#mrs-y-r-botha">
            <from>Mrs Y R BOTHA</from>
            <p>Thank you, hon Deputy Speaker. The Portfolio Committee on Social Development, having considered and deliberated on the 2010-11 annual report of the National Development Agency, NDA, looked at the report very critically. As we know, the committee, as part of exercising its oversight function, received a briefing from the NDA on its performance.</p>
            <p>The NDA is a Schedule 3 Public Entity, established in terms of section 2 of the National Development Agency Act, Act 108 of 1998. Its primary mandate is to contribute to the eradication of poverty and its causes, by granting funds to civil society organisations for the purpose of carrying out projects or programmes aimed at meeting the development of poor communities, and strengthening the institutional capacity of other civil society organisations involved in direct service provision to poor communities.</p>
            <p>In regard to the committee's observations, we have noted that there is a need for the NDA to refocus its strategic objectives and align them with the mandate of the Department of Social Development and government priorities. This would change the perception of the NDA as being solely a poverty alleviation entity. The mandate of the NDA should be expanded to include early childhood development programmes, as it had already focused on that in the previous financial year.</p>
            <p>It further noted that the budget of the NDA has been reduced to R33 million. It thus advised that the agency should have revised its strategic plan to reflect the changes in the budget, and set new targets to avoid discrepancies in reporting on the initial strategic plan and the achievements.</p>
            <p>It also noted that the NDA took a decision to ring-fence the funding for capacity-building of projects, as capacity-building is important to ensure that projects are sustainable and also able to source funding.</p>
            <p>The committee made the following recommendation: that the NDA should consider awarding funding to projects based on poverty levels, instead of population size, as it had been doing. This would enable projects in provinces where there are high poverty levels to receive funding. Thank you, Deputy Speaker.</p>

          <speech by="#mr-m-r-sonto">
            <from>Mr M R SONTO</from>
            <p>Deputy Speaker, in adopting its strategic plan earlier this year, the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises identified Eskom's capacity expansion programme as one of the key focus areas for its oversight programme. In June the committee undertook an oversight visit to Eskom power stations, namely Medupi, Kusile and Duvha. Based on the committee's observation and interaction with Eskom's project management teams at all three power stations, we noted that the main power stations under construction were on track, and both projects were within schedule.</p>
            <p>The first unit at Medupi is scheduled to be commissioned in 2013, whilst the last unit is scheduled for commissioning by 2015. On completion, this station will add to the national grid about 4 788 MW of capacity.</p>
            <p>The same can be said of the construction of Kusile Power Station. The first unit is planned for commercial operation in 2014 and the last unit will be in commercial operation by 2018. On completion, Kusile Power Station will add about 4 800 MW to the national grid.</p>
            <p>The Duvha Power Station was operating at full capacity, except for Unit 4, which was reported to have exploded and been partly decommissioned after it failed an over-speed limit test. The incident took place on 9 February 2011, but the committee was assured that the rebuilding process was under way in order to return the unit to service.</p>
            <p>The committee noted the recent protest strike by workers at the construction site in Medupi, but is pleased that the matter was quickly resolved, before it got out of control. We, as the committee, are happy that order has been restored and that work has resumed.</p>
            <p>The committee also met with Transnet's Second Defined Benefit Fund and was happy with the progress made so far.</p>
            <p>The committee also met with South African Express, and it was less satisfied with their financial reporting system, following their withdrawal of the entity's 2010-11 financial report after it was tabled in Parliament. We support the action taken by the Minister to dissolve the board.</p>
            <p>On behalf of the committee, I table this report for consideration by Parliament. I thank you.</p>

          <speech by="#mr-l-t-landers">
            <from>Mr L T LANDERS</from>
            <p>Deputy Speaker, the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development presents the cases of two magistrates. The portfolio committee recommends to this House that the National Assembly confirms the removal from office as magistrate of Magistrate Mr M Tyulu and Magistrate Ms N E Ndamase and that the salary of Mr Tyulu be withheld.</p>
            <p>When magistrates are accused of wrongdoing or unlawful activities, the matter is referred to the Magistrate's Commission where these magistrates are expected to appear and to answer to charges brought against them.</p>
            <p>In the case of Mr Tyulu, he was found guilty of the sexual harassment of a female accused in a criminal matter before him. To compound matters, Mr Tyulu already had a previous disciplinary record hanging over him.</p>
            <p>In the case of Ms Ndamase, she was found guilty on 11 charges of misconduct, ranging from contraventions of the Code of Conduct for Magistrates, negligence in carrying out her duties and absenteeism, to refusal to execute lawful orders.</p>
            <p>The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development is satisfied that in both these cases due process has been followed; hence our recommendation that these two be removed from office as magistrates. We ask this House's approval and confirmation of this decision. Thank you.</p>
            <p>There was no debate.</p>
            <p>Question put: That the Report of the Committee be adopted and the withholding of remuneration of Magistrate M Tyulu be approved.</p>

            <from>The DEPUTY SPEAKER</from>
            <p>Order! Hon members, as I said, that was the last item. Before I conclude, let me say that you will remember that during question time on Wednesday, 15 August 2012, two points of order were put requesting the presiding officer to make a ruling on the use of unparliamentary language by members of this House. The first point of order was put by hon Kalyan. The hon member requested that the presiding officer rule out of order a statement by hon Manamela, who said, according to the Hansard, that:</p>
            <p>The second aspect is that the DA has no right to speak about violence during strikes because they are the ones who went to incite violence in front of Cosatu House.</p>
            <p>I undertook to study the Hansard. Having had an opportunity to do so, I wish to rule as follows.</p>
            <p>Rule 63, which deals with offensive or unparliamentary language, is a broadly framed rule that allows the presiding officer to take into consideration the context and tone of a particular remark or inference. The rule has been elucidated by years of established practice and convention.</p>
            <p>Hon Manamela's statement clearly reflected on a political party and not on the character of a particular member of this House. A reflection on a political party, as perceived by a member of another party, is not out of order, as long as the member in question did not cast aspersions on the character of members of this House.</p>
            <p>The approach I have taken is consistent with previous rulings by presiding officers of this House, that held that reference to a political party in this manner is not out of order. I therefore rule that the statement by hon Manamela was not unparliamentary. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>The DEPUTY SPEAKER</from>
            <p>Hon members, the second point of order was put by the Minister of Higher Education and Training, who referred to a statement by hon Van der Westhuizen to the effect that:</p>
            <p>We also believe that the government, when dealing with Cosatu, should require Cosatu to discipline its members to stop inciting violence, to respect the laws of this country and to respect human life, even when their majority status as a labour union comes under threat.</p>
            <p>The Minister requested that it be declared unparliamentary.</p>
            <p>Having studied the Hansard, I wish to rule as follows.</p>
            <p>Taking into account my earlier ruling about reflections on political parties not being out of order, and having due regard for the fact that Cosatu is not a political party represented in this House, I find that hon Van Der Westhuizen's remarks did not cast aspersions on the character of any member of this House and can thus not be ruled unparliamentary.</p>
            <p>Having said that, I would like to urge members, as other presiding officers have done previously, to refrain from making inflammatory, divisive and unsubstantiated statements in the House.</p>

            <from>The DEPUTY SPEAKER</from>
            <p>Order! Hon members, on 22 August 2012, during a reply to a question, the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development said:</p>
            <p>I think the so-called Cope is dancing to the tune of the smear campaign against Adv Nomgcobo Jiba.</p>
            <p>Subsequently, hon Kganare rose on a point of order and asked whether it was parliamentary for the hon Minister to refer to Cope, which is a political party elected to this Parliament, as the "so-called" Cope. Having now had an opportunity to study the unrevised Hansard, I wish to rule as follows.</p>
            <p>The test of a genuine point of order is whether the Chair can actually rule on it because it relates to the rules and practice of the House. Therefore, in this instance the question is whether the phrase is acceptable parliamentary language, or not. The expression is not unparliamentary as it is a point of debate.</p>

            <from>The DEPUTY SPEAKER</from>
            <p>Order! Hon members, the next point of order was in the same debate and was raised by hon McGluwa. It was whether the Deputy Minister of Police was implying that the DA was friends with gangsters, when she said:</p>
            <p>Abona bantu bazaziyo izigebenga ukuba zihlala phi yiDA ngoba uMEC weDA uneengxoxo azibiza ngokuba zii-peace accords apho ahlala khona neenkokeli ze-gangsters, bezama iindlela zokufikelela kwisivumelwano ekulweni le nto. Ngoko ke oyena mntu uzaziyo izigebenga nguDA, makazibuze pha ku-MEC Dan Plato. (Translation of IsiXhosa paragraph follows.)</p>
            <p>[The DA are the ones who know where the criminals are because their MEC organises meetings, which he calls "peace accords", in which he sits with gangster leaders trying to arrive at a solution to fight gangsterism. Therefore, the DA are the ones who know who the criminals are. Ask the MEC, Mr Dan Plato.]</p>
            <p>The reference is to the interaction of the DA with gangsters. We have consistently ruled that references to a party are not unparliamentary, even when those same references may have been unparliamentary if they had been directed specifically at a member of this House.</p>
            <p>A distinction should therefore be drawn between allusions directed at members and expressions of opinion and belief in relation to political parties. Such views or opinions against political parties are regarded as part of generally acceptable political discourse. The statement is therefore not unparliamentary.</p>

          <p>The process followed during the oversight included the following: 6.1 Tourism Development in King Sabatha Dalindyebo (KSD) Municipality</p>
          <p>6.1.1 The KSD Integrated Development Plan (IDP) prioritises tourism as one of the key economic drivers. The tourism industry at the KSD can be summarised into: attractions, accommodation, access and amenities.</p>
          <p>6.1.2 The iconic attractions in the area include Coffee Bay as part of the renowned Wild Coast. The Nelson Mandela Museum complex comprises of the Nelson Mandela Museum in Mthatha, Qunu and Mvezo. The Municipality seeks to aggressively promote these attraction sites.</p>
          <p>6.1.3 KSD Municipality has much potential in terms of economic growth and there are private investment and government initiatives aimed at developing the entire region.</p>
          <p>6.1.4 Potential projects that have been identified are the Liberation Route which seeks to link with Chris Hani and Bizana for a Provincial Route.</p>
          <p>6.1.5 Secondly, the Nelson Mandela Cultural precinct has reached the feasibility. This will promote pedestrian zones along the Owen Street. The third area of attraction is the Langeni Forest / Mabelani Dam landscape. The area boasts scenic beauty.</p>
          <p>6.1.6 The Langeni Forest cluster is a Presidential Intervention project driven by KSD Municipality in partnership with OR Tambo District Municipality and the Department of Human Settlement.</p>
          <p>6.1.7 Coffee Bay is an area that is ripe for tourism and leisure investment. There is opportunity to establish a tour operating business in the area as well as training of tour guides. 6.2 Nelson Mandela Youth and Heritage Centre</p>
          <p>6.2.1 The Department of Arts and Culture commissioned the project as a gift to Nelson Mandela who in turn requested that the buildings be designed for the enjoyment of all South Africans, particularly children.</p>
          <p>6.2.2 The chiefs and headmen of the surrounding villages were consulted regarding their vision of the proposed development. All agreed that local vernacular architectural language could be drawn and should reflect simple buildings of international appeal.</p>
          <p>6.2.3 The Museum was officially opened on 11 February 2000, at a function that coincided with the 10th anniversary of Mandela's release from prison in 1999.</p>
          <p>6.2.4 It was opened in three sites: Mvezo, The Nelson Mandela Youth and Heritage Centre in Qunu and the historic Bhunga Building in Umthatha.</p>
          <p>6.2.5 Since opening, the Centre has proved popular among corporates, attracting business from Development Bank of Southern Africa, the Business summit and the Mandela Rhodes scholarship beneficiaries, amongst others.</p>
          <p>6.2.6 The Youth Centre boasts world-class facilities that include; boardrooms, a mini hall that can be used for seminar-styled sessions and high tech electrical equipment and a restaurant.</p>

          <p>6.3 Projects funded by National Department of Tourism</p>
          <p>6.3.1 The Social Responsibility Implementation programme (SRI) is funded by the Extended Public Works Programme (EPWP) the projects aim to create short term employment by creating jobs using labour intensive methods and providing skills development.</p>
          <p>6.3.2 SRI programme seeks to contribute to job creation through the use of labour-intensive methods targeting the unemployed, youth, women, the disabled and SMMEs.</p>
          <p>6.3.3 The National Department of Tourism has funded tourism products within the OR Tambo District Municipality. Mbashe, Coffee Bay, Mvezo, Nelson Mandela Museum Phase 1 and 2 were also funded by the NDT as part of Bhunga and Qunu Museums.</p>

          <p>6.4 Tourism Development in Mbhashe Local Municipality</p>
          <p>6.4.1 Mbhashe Local Municipality is one of the eight local municipalities under the jurisdiction of Amathole District Municipality. Municipality comprised of three towns of Dutywa, Gatyana and Xhora and numerous rural settlements.</p>
          <p>6.4.2 One of the ways to achieve its developmental agenda is the development of tourism as one of the key sectors in Local Economic Development.</p>
          <p>3. The Municipality has adopted a Tourism Master Plan which aimed to position Mbhashe as a tourism destination and leverage on visitors to the District and to promote and market the area as a preferred tourist destination. The Municipality through its towns of Dutywa, Elliotdale and Willowvale has many diverse attractions which can be linked and packaged for tourism. These include: heritage and cultural tourism development, coastal development, craft development and recreational facilities.</p>
          <p>4. Mbhashe Coastal Tourism Development will be aligned with the Wild Coast Spatial Development Initiative and Wild Coast Development policy. The area to which it applies includes the 1000 metres above the high-water mark as well as tidal portion of estuaries.</p>
          <p>5. Based on the policy guidelines, spatial mapping was prepared for the entire coastal area. The mapping depicts the various Normal Control Zones (1st and 2nd order nodes), Eco-tourism zones and conservation zones. In Mbhashe the following areas were earmarked for development in the coastal zone which include: Qhora, Nqabarha, Dwesa-Cwebe, Beechwood, Qatywa among others.</p>
          <p>Challenges:</p>
          <p>* Gcalekaland Cultural Village Group was initiated in 2003, the municipality appointed the implementing agency to develop a business plan for the purpose of sourcing funds for the project. The Agency had not been successful in sourcing funding from National Department of Tourism, National Lottery and National Heritage Council.</p>
          <p>* Qatywa Chalets Tourism Lodge which is funded by the Department of Tourism, but due to technical difficulties the project has not yet started. The challenge arises from the basic assessment report that was submitted to DEDEAT but there were some issues in the report that were not covered that caused the delay. Hence they are still awaiting the environmental authorisation to start the project.</p>
          <p>* Dutywa Tourism Dam is used for recreational and conference facilities, the service provider was appointed by DEDEAT to conduct a feasibility study. 6.5 Site visit to Nqabarha Lodge</p>
          <p>Nqabarha Lodge generated community expectations such as:</p>
          <p>1. The development of an enterprise that generates income and contributes to the upliftment of the community across the 13 villages. 2. The income to be generated to flow into the community through the lease / rental arrangement and generate jobs. 3. Income-generating opportunities will be through (food supply, guiding, security, fishing ferry services, craft sales, laundry and catering services); and 4. The current grant allocated for the lodge is R3 million.</p>
          <p>Key challenges</p>
          <p>* The community requires the issuing of the long term lease by the Department of Land Affairs. * Need to find a private operator who will enter into shareholding relationship with Nqabarha Tourism Development Trust. * Finding an operator who will bring operating capital, knowledge and experience and demonstrate willingness to train local community in hospitality trade. * Access road water and electricity supply. * More funds to expand the lodge to make it viable business entity.</p>
          <p>6.6 Nqabarha Tourism Development Trust</p>
          <p>A number of Community Development Trusts have been established and registered on various areas for dealing with development in specific areas.</p>
          <p>1. The Nqabarha community started in 1999 to galvanise themselves to manage the natural resources surrounding in order to preserve the indigenous knowledge for future generations and also to exploit forest related opportunities.</p>
          <p>2. In 2001, the community started identifying tourism related projects and had a list of 33 projects which were later scaled down to 10 projects as a start.</p>
          <p>3. One of the projects was the Medicinal Garden project which was established in 2003 with an assistance from the Department of Water Affairs and the Danish Company.</p>
          <p>4. In 2008, Mbhashe Municipality having observed the low production of these medicinal plants intervened and trained them to produce seedlings and assisted with fencing material.</p>
          <p>5. The purpose was to assist the workers on the project to survive while they continue with the medicinal plant business. It was reported that the project has 12 people on site, comprised of 6 women, 2 men and 4 unemployed youth.</p>
          <p>Findings and challenges</p>
          <p>* The committee visited the medicinal garden and could not find any medicinal plants. * There were only four elderly women working on the garden when the committee arrived. * The major challenge expressed was the scarcity of water for irrigation. 6.7 Tourism Development in Port St. Johns Municipality</p>
          <p>The Executive Mayor gave an overview of the Wild Coast: 1. Poverty and unemployment rates have deteriorated over the period 1994 to 2011. 2. There has been no significant increase in agricultural activity. 3. The Wild Coast is still among the least serviced regions of the country in relation to safe water, sanitation, roads, telecommunication and educational infrastructure. 4. There has been significant increase in tourism establishments, including community-owned initiatives. 5. Several land claims have been settled but there are still outstanding issues needing attention. 6. Commercial community forestry has started and it has a huge potential. 7. Decrease in prevalence of crime.</p>
          <p>6.8 Integrated Wild Coast Development Initiatives</p>
          <p>The rationale for the Integrated Programme Approach seeks to:</p>
          <p>1. Ensure accelerated project development through the mobilisation of financial and technical support. 2. Facilitate coordination and harnessing of resources for project development and implementation. 3. Ensure a balance between sustainable economic development and environmental management; and 4. Position the Wild Coast as new Special Economic Zone (SEZ). 6.9 Key challenges</p>
          <p>The following were challenges raised by the Port St. Johns Municipality:</p>
          <p>1. Decline in tourism and low occupancy rate as a result of the impact of shark attacks and negative perceptions on general safety and security of beaches. None of the beaches has blue flag status. 2. Very low skills base and about 90 percent of accommodation, food and beverages facilities are run by owners and employ less than 5 people who are unskilled or semi-skilled. 3. Non-existence of up-market facilities in terms of both accommodation and restaurants and the majority falling in two to three star grading. 4. Implementation and enforcement of by-laws with regards to liquor licensing, performance of traditional rituals at beaches. 5. Bulk infrastructure in terms of water borne sewerage, storm water management and water reticulation, among others. 6.

          <p>The Committee having undertaken oversight visits to Mpumalanga from 4-8 June 2012, reports as follows:</p>
          <p>1. Background</p>
          <p>This oversight visit is part of on going implementation of the committee programme adopted in 2010. At a workshop co-hosted by the National Department of Tourism and the committee on 16 March 2010, the Department reported that it was experiencing challenges in the Provinces with regards to intergovernmental linkages in the tourism sector. The Department further stated that part of the challenge is that the fact that tourism is a concurrent function in terms of the Constitution of South Africa.</p>
          <p>High on the list of challenges within the tourism sector was the fragmentation of tourism planning across the three spheres of government, inadequate database of the supply side, with associated lack of reliable market information and poor integration of tourism with other sectoral policies. The committee took a decision to visit all the nine Provinces to assess the state of the provincial tourism sector. The committee decided to cluster the Provinces as follows:</p>
          <p>* 2010 - Limpopo and Northern Cape * 2011 - North West and Gauteng * 2012 - Mpumalanga and Eastern Cape.</p>
          <p>2. Introduction</p>
          <p>Tourism is identified as a priority economic sector to fulfill government's imperative to create sustainable jobs and to ensure that the developmental agenda is addressed in all areas, particularly the rural areas.</p>
          <p>Government has set five key priorities for the current term including the creation of decent work and sustainable livelihoods. These priorities have been converted into government's Medium Term Strategic Framework which highlights priorities and outcomes over the MTEF period. The committee therefore monitors the contribution of the tourism sector to the creation of decent employment through inclusive growth.</p>
          <p>Unlocking the potential of tourism is dependent on it receiving substantial financial and logistical support from the government, private sector, communities and the labour sector. It is only if such support is demonstrated will tourism be in a position to play the expected role of achieving the competitive edge needed by the economy.</p>
          <p>The committee is mandated to conduct oversight in an effort to extract optimum benefits for the country from the resources and capacities available to the three spheres of government. The Committee undertook a provincial oversight visit to Mpumalanga in 2012 to assess achievements of the sector and evaluate the nature of challenges, prospects for inclusive growth particularly in the rural areas and the extent of government support at all levels.</p>
          <p>3. National priorities</p>
          <p>In line with national priorities relevant to the developmental agenda relating to the tourism sector, the committee identified the following:</p>

Impact of crime in the industry and the response thereto.</p>
          <p>4. Objectives of the visit</p>

          <p>The Committee made the following observations during the oversight:</p>
          <p>I. Rural tourism development remains a challenge. Government departments should tailor responses to this challenge in terms of programmes and budgets to address disparities and in an aligned programme to optimise actions that would cushion the vulnerable groups.</p>
          <p>II. To ensure that the current EPWP Programmes are sustainable, they should be closely monitored and evaluated. This would assist in addressing concerns raised by the Auditor General in the 2010/11 financial year; including the difficulties of obtaining information specifically the statistics on the number of jobs created and the effectiveness or impact of the EPWP projects run by Department of Tourism on behalf of the communities.</p>
          <p>III. There is no overlap of roles where the marketing of tourism locally and internationally is concerned.</p>
          <p>IV. The support the different enterprises receive from the Department and how many of these enterprises actually yield positive results from this support is not clearly demonstrated.</p>
          <p>V. Refocus on heritage and cultural heritage projects - there was a greater need for investment towards cultural and heritage tourism. Heritage and cultural sites should be kept at an acceptable tourism level. The refocus on such sites would benefit poor rural communities.</p>
          <p>VI. The importance of tourist road signage is often underestimated. Local government tourist road signage is extremely limited. It is also difficult to understand many of the historical sites of the township without a guide given the lack of interpretive boards.</p>
          <p>VII. There is an often breakdown in communication between local, provincial and national spheres with regards to the permissions and standards in tourism signage.</p>
          <p>VIII. The linkages both ways on tourism related issues between national, provincial and local spheres are weak. There needs to be improved working relationships on tourism-related issues between municipalities and regional stakeholders through collaborative alliances.</p>
          <p>IX. There is a need for a defined tourism support package (resources, funding and capacity) to support local government. Resources to assist and direct investment at local government to realise tourism opportunities. A knowledge and exchange platform to highlight best practice case studies from other municipalities to encourage peer-to- peer learning.</p>
          <p>X. Tourism features very low on the priority outputs of the local municipalities due to priority needs such as water, electricity, infrastructure, housing sport and recreation. As a result, municipalities regard tourism as an unfunded mandate placed on local government.</p>
          <p>XI. The current lack of specific budget allocation towards the development of tourism at local government level is a challenge and results in low impact projects, unsustainable initiatives, and "wish lists" instead of "action plans."</p>
          <p>9. Recommendations Based on the stakeholder engagements, submissions by provincial authorities and site visits and the common challenges identified, the committee recommends as follows:</p>
          <p>I. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP's): The Department should double its efforts by ensuring that the notion of private-public partnerships is a well endorsed practice for building capacity to delivery in the tourism and hospitality sectors.</p>
          <p>II. Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs): All spheres of government should work towards strengthening competitiveness and promotion of SMMEs and cooperatives as they remain the cornerstone for growth of the economy and creation of work opportunities within the tourism and hospitality sectors.</p>
          <p>III. The Department needs to facilitate market access and entry into the value chain by small businesses and cooperatives and reduce regulatory burden on small businesses.</p>
          <p>IV. Local Government: The local sphere of government is an important contributor to the success of tourism activities in terms of community driven tourism philosophy. The efforts should be coordinated within the provincial tourism growth strategy.</p>
          <p>V. Job creation at local level: tourism is a demand-driven sector. Therefore the volume and value of demand inform investment in supply and job creation. Provision of public infrastructure supporting local economic development is improved. This will assist municipalities to focus Local Economic Development initiatives that are skills creating, employment generating and domestic production and consumption promoting.</p>
          <p>VI. Signage and road infrastructure: poor road signage and infrastructure impact negatively on access to tourism products, especially in rural areas. The co-operative work between the Department of Tourism and the Department of Transport to be intensified.</p>
          <p>VII. Tourism information: Public education, awareness and information dissemination should be linked to outreach initiatives of the Department.</p>
          <p>VIII. Synergic linkages should be developed and harnessed at all spheres of government so as to promote local tourism activities and strategic partnerships.</p>
          <p>IX. Transformation of the tourism sector: There should greater action taken to support and implement Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) as well as procurement policy implemented to achieve the BBEEE imperatives of government.</p>
          <p>X. Air Lift Strategy: Aligning air transport with other national strategies through the common criteria of the national interest through interdepartmental participation with regards to National Foreign Policy, National Trade and Industry Strategy as well as general infrastructure requirements of South Africa. Reduced total cost of travel to South Africa should be the central focus of the strategy. XI. Skills Development: while the committee acknowledges the initiatives taken by the department to engage five universities in the country to develop skills and capacity the industry, there is also a need to support FET colleges and Sector Education and Training Authorities to be linked to business, industry and other advanced education and training programmes.</p>
          <p>XII. Cost of air travel: Travel by air to Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga provinces is too expensive. There is a need for national government to assist to increase number of flights and reduce cost of flights.</p>
          <p>XIII. Implementation of infrastructure development: Parliament should prioritise overseeing the implementation of infrastructure development aligned to rural communities and also ascertain support facilities in rural areas for tourism sector.</p>
          <p>XIV. Extended Public Works Programme: There should be greater focus on monitoring the outputs and outcomes of Extended Public Work Programmes as it holds potential for poverty relief and providing first level skills and opportunity for productive citizenry.</p>
          <p>10. Appreciation</p>
          <p>The committee would like to extend the special appreciation to MEC in the Province, the Executive Mayors, Provincial Head of Department, municipal managers, project managers and all the officials who provided support throughout the provincial oversight trip.</p>
          <p>11. Conclusion Education and training remains a critical element for the development and growth of tourism in the provinces. Although the current state of tourism in the Province is not completely satisfactory, there is a huge potential for the Province to advance in the tourism sector. However, for this to happen, there is a need for the tourism budget allocation in the Province to be increased to allow for this potential to be unlocked. This will significantly increase the contribution of tourism to job creation and sustainable livelihoods, as part of the key national priorities of Government. Report to be considered.</p>

          <p>The Committee having undertaken oversight visit to Eastern, Western and Central Regions from 18-22 June 2012, reports as follows:</p>
          <p>1. Introduction</p>
          <p>In support of the national effort for development and as part of assessing the state of tourism in the Provinces, the Committee visited the Western, Eastern and Central Regions of the Eastern Cape.</p>
          <p>Tourism has been prioritised by the Provincial Government as one of the economic sectors that contribute to the country's gross domestic product (GDP), create employment and mitigate the impact of poverty. This is in line with the current policy imperatives of the New Growth Path and the Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP 2). Sustainable and responsible tourism development has a triple effect in terms of social, economic and environmental benefits. The committee is mandated to conduct oversight in an effort to extract optimum benefits for the country from the resources and capacities available to the three spheres of government. The Committee felt that it was necessary to undertake a provincial oversight visit to Eastern Cape Province in 2012 to assess achievements of the sector and evaluate the nature of challenges, prospects for inclusive growth particularly in the rural areas and the extent of government support at all levels.</p>
          <p>2. National priorities In line with national priorities relevant to the developmental agenda relating to the tourism sector, the committee identified the following:</p>
          <p>2.1 Inclusive growth that creates jobs and promotes sustainable livelihoods with meaningful participation of the historically disadvantaged communities and individuals. 2.2 Involvement of rural communities in tourism growth and development in the mainstream industry. 2.3 Assess the skills development in the industry. Impact of crime in the industry and the response thereto.</p>
          <p>3. Objectives of the visit</p>
          <p>The Tourism White Paper spells out the functions of national government as establishing and facilitating enabling and appropriate legal and fiscal frameworks for the tourism industry and facilitating the sustainable and responsible development of the industry, by formulating developmental guidelines and regulatory measures. The objectives of the oversight visit, included:</p>
          <p>3.1 To enhance cooperation and coordination between all spheres of government in developing and managing tourism. 3.2 To promote for growth and development of the tourism sector. 3.3 To promote quality tourism products and services 3.4 To assess the level of stakeholder participation - both in the public and private sectors. 3.5 To assess support for cultural and heritage tourism growth. 3.6 To assess the implementation of the Extended Public Works (EPWP) and its outputs and outcomes. 3.7 To assess for the support for sustainable livelihoods with regards to small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs), cooperatives and individuals; and 3.8 To enhance and promote responsible tourism for the benefit of South Africa and the enjoyment of all its citizens and foreign visitors.</p>
          <p>4. Delegation</p>
          <p>The delegation comprised the following members:</p>
          <p>|Political Party |Representative/s | |African National |Mr. D.M Gumede, MP (Leader of the | |Congress |delegation) | | |Ms. X.C Makasi, MP | | |Mr. F Bhegu, MP | | |Ms. R.M.M Lesoma, MP | | |Ms. J.M Maluleke, MP | | |Mr. L.P Khoarai, MP | | |Mr. X.

          <p>6. Briefing sessions, stakeholder engagements and site visits</p>
          <p>The process followed during the oversight visit in Eastern Cape included the following:</p>
          <p>6.1 Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency (ECPTA)</p>
          <p>6.1.1 Briefing by the Chief Executive Officer</p>
          <p>I. Poverty zones in the Eastern Cape indicate the spatial focus and potential impact zones for socio-economic interventions. As most of the income for Parks come from local market it is assumed that spending comes from the economic power zones in the province.</p>
          <p>II. Financial consideration was a key driver in the drafting of the ECPTA business case. Precedence has set by mergers completed in other Provinces where merged entities outperformed non-merged entities.</p>
          <p>III. Of concern was the apparent correlation between increase in the government grant and the decrease in revenue. This dependency on grants created the perception that as the size of the government grant increase, the drive, commitment and incentives towards securing own revenue decreased.</p>
          <p>IV. The primary goal of the ECPTA is to ensure stakeholder and shareholder confidence. From a strategic level, this requires the achievement of the core elements of the business case, which is the primary focus of the shareholder and the Board.</p>
          <p>V. ECPTA Act No. 2 of 2010 took effect on 1 July 2010 and confers powers and duties to ECPTA to manage protected areas and develop and facilitate tourism; and establish Eastern Cape Tourism Development Fund amongst others.</p>
          <p>VI. Eastern Cape Tourism Development Fund aims to empower disadvantaged individuals in the tourism sector and may consist of percentage funding appropriated to ECPTA, donations, provincial tourism levy and any other funding.</p>
          <p>VII. The ECPTA is currently in phase two of the three phase broad phases to ensure effective and efficient operational execution (merger consolidation, expansion and consolidation).</p>
          <p>VIII. In terms of marketing and geographic spread, the province has 109 projects ranging from the infrastructure, tourism, conservation and reserves.</p>
          <p>IX. Inter-governmental relations in the tourism industry had been included as a key performance area in the annual performance plan of the ECPTA. Some of the results include: integrated approach to fast-tracking the development of tourism infrastructure with the support and commitment of R95 million from Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism (DEDEAT). The R30 million commitment from the DEDEAT for the hosting of key iconic events in the Province. In this regard African Open has yielded R150 million on a R9 million investment.</p>
          <p>X. In terms of its strategic and operational plan the ECPTA will create 2 276 jobs in relation to its direct operations. This excludes the construction jobs that the R95 million infrastructure commitment will yield. The planned jobs per financial year detailed as follows: 2012/13 (423 jobs), 2013/14 (913 jobs), and 2014/15 (940 jobs).</p>
          <p>XI. Through relations with the industry, ECPTA ensured placement of all 39 Chefs and 24 tourism buddies in both the private and the public sector. The mentorship programme has contributed to creation of 229 jobs in the sector between 2009 to 2011financial years. Created 10 SMME opportunities during the reserve upgrade process; and created 40 temporal job opportunities during the reserve upgrade.</p>
          <p>XII. In response to the Provincial Tourism Master Plan and National Tourism Sector Strategy, ECPTA has prioritised skills development for the industry. The Agency has partnered with the Eastern Cape Development Cooperation and Tourism Enterprise Partnership for skills development. The programme also facilitated linkages and partnerships for the participants resulting to increased revenues and business contracts.</p>
          <p>XIII. In order to negate the culture of poor service in the tourism industry and related sectors, the ECPTA implemented and supported the: ETEYA National Awards, Welcome Awards, Adventure Tourism &amp; Conservation Awards; and Service Excellence seminars. The Agency created platforms for international and national market access for 60 tourism products; and further supported grading of about 300 accommodation establishments in the past three years.</p>
          <p>XIV. To promote cultural and natural diversity the Agency initiated and supported various provincial events such as: Isingqi Sethu Festival; Grahamstown Arts Festival; Africa Open Golf Tournament; Buyelekhaya Music Festival; Wild Coast Jikeleza; and Rose Garden Festival and others. In order to ensure sustainability of events more funding is required.</p>
          <p>XV. Redesigned the Provincial Tourism Forum as an active platform to engage with stakeholders and also established in-house capacity through Stewardship programme and People and Parks mechanisms directly engage with stakeholders. Launched - new Coastal Route in partnership with the industry. 6.1.2 Challenges highlighted</p>
          <p>I. The country needs to implement the Airlift Strategy for ECPTA. The Province needs the National Department of Tourism to assist in increasing the number of flights into the Eastern Cape and at the same time reduce cost of flights. First prize would be direct international flights that would allow international tour operators to fly directly to the Eastern Cape.</p>
          <p>II. The revenue from the SA Tourism levies should be proportionally allocated to the tourism routes and Province so that it can be applied directly to the benefit of the province where it was generated.</p>
          <p>III. The lead time for obtaining provincial statistics from SA Tourism is too long and reduces the ability of tourism managers to measure and manage the industry.</p>
          <p>IV. Additional support is required to support interventions such as the "Home of the Legends" from a national tourism perspective.</p>
          <p>V. Additional financial resources required to enable the ten provincial routes to be able to host at least one iconic event per year in each route. Iconic events generated exceptional returns on investment.</p>
          <p>VI. Need technical assistance via Department of Trade and Industry and Tourism to cluster the Eastern Cape Tourism Industry to increase its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
          <p>VII. National Treasury to create mechanism that would allow for faster commercialisation of Provincial tourism assets in support of BBBEE.</p>
          <p>2. Tsitsikama Tourism Stakeholder engagement session</p>
          <p>6.2.1 Briefing by Mr Peter Myles: Private Sector</p>
          <p>I. Market researchers try to gather information about customer's perceptions and attitudes on a whole variety of subjects, from particular products and brands, to government policy and even their hopes for the future. II. This information can then be used to design products and services that meet customers' needs or to design marketing campaigns that communicate effectively with a products' target market. III. Market research is the systematic collection of information about supply and demand in tourism to guide the formulation of policies, strategies and plans for those concerned with the management of tourism interests, including government. IV. Eastern Cape tourism competitor analysis shows the province is the fifth in terms of 2007 and 2008 bed night statistics with 3.9 million and 3.8 million respectively. V. Overnight stays is the measurement of tourism performance, and in 2009 the Province had a share of 3.1 million for the year. VI. In 2011, the Eastern Cape provincial distribution in terms of bed night was 3.3 million with 3.7 percent being foreign arrivals. This is in contrast with 2004, when bed night was 3.4 million with 7.5 percent being foreign arrivals. VII. The Eastern Cape Province is third largest domestic tourism market in South Africa.</p>
          <p>6.2.2 Challenges highlighted the private sector There is a need for local tourism statistics</p>
          <p>I. There are no published tourism statistics for cities and towns in South Africa. II. The only local statistics available are when cities and towns start collecting their own data from the accommodation providers. III. However, this is a difficult task because accommodation providers are reluctant to share their guest information and occupancy rates with other service providers; and IV. It is worth investigating if raw data is available from Statistics South Africa.</p>
          <p>6.3 Port Alfred Tourism Stakeholder engagement session</p>
          <p>6.3.1 Briefing by Sunshine Coast Tourism in partnership with Ndlambe Municipality</p>
          <p>I. Sunshine Coast Tourism and Ndlambe Municipality have entered into a partnership and signed Service Level Agreement and have fully constituted guiding constitution. II. Ndlambe Municipality is constituted by Port Alfred (Tourism Business Forum), Kenton (Tourism and Chamber of Business), Alexandria (Canon Rocks) and Bathurst / Kleinemonde. III. Sunshine Coast Tourism monthly reports are submitted timeously to Ndlambe Municipality and monthly reporting on performance available as open documents on Council Agenda. IV. SCT has removed past negative perceptions of tourism in Ndlambe. Tourism speaks as one body instead of 2 fragmented tourism offices and a Municipality body. Buy-in has been secured from Port Alfred Business Forum and Bushmans Chamber of Business. V. Created a dynamic website reflecting the richness and diversity of Ndlambe as a whole; and also created a professional, integrated and transformed tourism body. VI. There is a strong networking base with members and informative monthly newsletter is released. VII.

For example, a 3 x 3 metres stall use to cost R3 000. In 2012 the cost of the same space was R27 000. IX. Application for operating permit takes too long to be finalised. X. Tour Guides complain that it cost R800 to renew the certificate in every second year. XI. Zoning - the Province need to rediscover the 9 nodes. XII. The grading system by Tourism Grading Council is expensive and did not offer any marketing benefits. XIII. Tourism Levy: the stakeholders indicated willingness to pay the levy, but also wanted to receive benefit from the fee payment.</p>
          <p>3. Submission by Coffee Shack on Barriers to Entry and Alternatives to Grading System</p>
          <p>I. To encourage entrepreneurs and micro-start ups in the tourism sector, particularly in disadvantaged areas, there must be as few barriers to entry as possible. II. Any grading or certification is another barrier to entry as it involves time to fill out the paper work, money to pay for the grading assessment. The current system penalises remote and rural areas, as they have to pay more for transport of the assessor.</p>
          <p>III. The argument that tourists need to know the standard and quality of a product is not sustainable as in most destinations in the world, there is no system of standard or grading, yet tourists keep returning to those destinations, many of which receive many tourists than South Africa.</p>
          <p>IV. The tourists use the previous methods of finding out which businesses are good and which are bad.</p>
          <p>V. The way customers and tourists and the world is evolving, it would be better for South African tourism industry to be ahead of the international tourism industry and be one of the fore runners of the new consumer driven ratings and grading system, as the United Kingdom is doing.</p>
          <p>VI. All the money, energy and time spent on having and maintaining a grading system in South Africa, could be used more effectively on transforming the tourism industry and also assisting the previously disadvantaged communities.</p>
          <p>VII. It has become common knowledge that both business and government agree that there is too much red tape, paper work, regulation in South Africa, which stifles entrepreneurs and small businesses. This is further acknowledged by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and National Planning Commission and many other parties. Grading is one more unnecessary barrier to entry. It must not be made to become compulsory.</p>
          <p>4. Briefing by the MEC of Economic Development and Environmental Affairs on infrastructure, skills development and tourism</p>
          <p>I. According to the Hon. MEC the focus for the next few years must be to unlock the potential of the Eastern Cape while addressing simultaneously challenges in the economy and the environment. The province believed that the emphasis must primarily be to facilitate, develop and support the local.</p>
          <p>II. The MEC indicated that the budget of the department will go down by 15 percent, but in real terms it will go down by 20 to 30 percent. As a result, there is a need for creatively mobilising the resources outside government for development.</p>
          <p>III. The primary issue that is a serious challenge to the province is the infrastructure and the competing needs. Infrastructure development required a different thinking. Hence, the Government view was to declare the Wild Coast as a corridor.</p>
          <p>IV. The Province requested the Committee to engage South African Airways (SAA) on the issue of Airlift strategy to align air transport with other national strategies through common criteria of the national interest. It was highlighted that the flower industry in the province had to die because harvested flowers could not reach the destination (London) on the same day.</p>
          <p>V. The health of auto sector, a leading manufacturing industry, remains critical in the province. There are opportunities to broaden and deepen automotive component manufacturing under DTI's Automotive Production Development Programme.</p>
          <p>VI. The province intend to accelerate companies access to the DTI's Manufacturing Competitive Enhancement Programme, to extend the provincial industrial jobs stimulus fund, and support additional proposals to the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) jobs fund.</p>
          <p>VII. In addition to the focus on upgrading economic infrastructure, the plan also aims to improve the ability to support the retention of existing industrial jobs, stimulate new jobs in priority sectors, build social economy and improve skills development processes.</p>
          <p>VIII. Manufacturing sector is responding well to these initiatives, and is known on what skills it requires. However, the challenge is the tourism sector because is not coordinated. There is a need to focus on training for tourism. The cluster approach appears to be working better.</p>
          <p>7. Findings / Observations</p>
          <p>The Committee made the following observations during the oversight:</p>
          <p>XII. Rural tourism development remains a challenge. Government departments should tailor responses to this challenge in terms of programmes and budgets to address disparities and in an aligned programme to optimise actions that would cushion the vulnerable groups.</p>
          <p>XIII. To ensure that the current EPWP Programmes are sustainable, they should be closely monitored and evaluated. This would assist in addressing concerns raised by the Auditor General in the 2010/11 financial year; including the difficulties of obtaining information specifically the statistics on the number of jobs created and the effectiveness or impact of the EPWP projects run by Department of Tourism on behalf of the communities.</p>
          <p>XIV. There is no overlap of roles where the marketing of tourism locally and internationally is concerned.</p>
          <p>XV. The support the different enterprises receive from the Department and how many of these enterprises actually yield positive results from this support is not clearly demonstrated.</p>
          <p>XVI. Refocus on heritage and cultural heritage projects - there was a greater need for investment towards cultural and heritage tourism. Heritage and cultural sites should be kept at an acceptable tourism level. The refocus on such sites would benefit poor rural communities.</p>
          <p>XVII. The importance of road signage to tourists is often underestimated. Local government tourist road signage is extremely limited. It is also difficult to understand many of the historical sites of the township without a guide given the lack of interpretive boards.</p>
          <p>XVIII. There is often breakdown in communication between local, provincial and national spheres with regards to the permissions and standards in tourism signage.</p>
          <p>XIX. The linkages both ways on tourism related issues between national, provincial and local spheres are weak. There needs to be improved working relationships on tourism-related issues between municipalities and regional stakeholders through collaborative alliances.</p>
          <p>XX. There is a need for a defined tourism support package (resources, funding and capacity) to support local government. Resources to assist and direct investment at local government to realise tourism opportunities. A knowledge and exchange platform to highlight best practice case studies from other municipalities to encourage peer-to- peer learning.</p>
          <p>XXI. Tourism features very low on the priority outputs of the local municipalities due to priority needs such as water, electricity, infrastructure, housing sport and recreation. As a result, municipalities regard tourism as an unfunded mandate placed on local government.</p>
          <p>XXII. The current lack of specific budget allocation towards the development of tourism at local government level is a challenge and results in low impact projects, unsustainable initiatives, and "wish lists" instead of "action plans."</p>
          <p>8. Recommendations</p>
          <p>Based on the stakeholder engagements, submissions by provincial authorities and site visits and the common challenges identified, the committee recommends as follows:</p>
          <p>XV. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP's): The Department should double its efforts by ensuring that the notion of private-public partnerships is a well endorsed practice for building capacity to delivery in the tourism and hospitality sectors. XVI. Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs): All spheres of government should work towards strengthening competitiveness and promotion of SMMEs and cooperatives as they remain the cornerstone for growth of the economy and creation of work opportunities within the tourism and hospitality sectors.</p>
          <p>XVII. The Department needs to facilitate market access and entry into the value chain by small businesses and cooperatives and reduce regulatory burden on small businesses.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Local Government: The local sphere of government is an important contributor to the success of tourism activities in terms of community driven tourism philosophy. The efforts should be coordinated within the provincial tourism growth strategy.</p>
          <p>XIX. Job creation at local level: tourism is a demand-driven sector. Therefore the volume and value of demand inform investment in supply and job creation. Provision of public infrastructure supporting local economic development is improved. This will assist municipalities to focus Local Economic Development initiatives that are skills creating, employment generating and domestic production and consumption promoting.</p>
          <p>XX. Signage and road infrastructure: poor road signage and infrastructure impact negatively on access to tourism products, especially in rural areas. The co-operative work between the Department of Tourism and the Department of Transport to be intensified.</p>
          <p>XXI. Tourism information: Public education, awareness and information dissemination should be linked to outreach initiatives of the Department.</p>
          <p>XXII. Synergic linkages should be developed and harnessed at all spheres of government so as to promote local tourism activities and strategic partnerships.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Transformation of the tourism sector: There should greater action taken to support and implement Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) as well as procurement policy implemented to achieve the BBEEE imperatives of government.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Air Lift Strategy: Aligning air transport with other national strategies through the common criteria of the national interest through interdepartmental participation with regards to National Foreign Policy, National Trade and Industry Strategy as well as general infrastructure requirements of South Africa. Reduced total cost of travel to South Africa should be the central focus of the strategy.</p>
          <p>XXV. Skills Development: while the committee acknowledges the initiatives taken by the department to engage five universities in the country to develop skills and capacity the industry, there is also a need to support FET colleges and Sector Education and Training Authorities to be linked to business, industry and other advanced education and training programmes.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Cost of air travel: Travel by air to Eastern Cape Province is too expensive. There is a need for national government to assist to increase number of flights and reduce cost of flights.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Implementation of infrastructure development: Parliament should prioritise overseeing the implementation of infrastructure development aligned to rural communities and also ascertain support facilities in rural areas for tourism sector. XXVIII. Extended Public Works Programme: There should be greater focus on monitoring the outputs and outcomes of Extended Public Work Programmes as it holds potential for poverty relief and providing first level skills and opportunity for productive citizenry.</p>
          <p>10. Appreciation</p>
          <p>The committee would like to extend the special appreciation to MEC in the Province, Committees of Provincial Legislature, Executive Mayors, Provincial Head of Department, municipal managers, project managers and all the officials who provided support throughout the provincial oversight trip.</p>
          <p>11. Conclusion The importance of intergovernmental relations and cooperative governance is of paramount importance for the growth of tourism in the country. There is a need for the Tourism National Strategy to be filtered down to municipal level in order to promote growth in the tourism sector. In as much as the Department has been instrumental in developing world class strategies and guidelines to promote tourism in the country; these strategies have not been implemented and if implemented in it is not in their entirety. In essence alignment of the three spheres remains a challenge. The geographic spread of tourism remains a major challenge especially in rural areas and successful growth in this area has an ability to translate positively towards transformation figures in the sector. In the same vein, it is important to engender a culture of innovation and that can only come about if space is created for an integrated approach involving feedback from the municipalities and other stakeholders.</p>

          <heading id="dbsh61">REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MINERAL RESOURCES AND THE REPORT OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL ON THE 2010/11 FINANCIAL YEAR, DATED 22 AUGUST 2012</heading>
          <p>1. Introduction</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts (the Committee) heard evidence on and considered the contents of the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor- General (AG) on the 2010/11 financial statements of the Department of Mineral Resources (the Department). The Committee noted the qualified audit opinion, highlighted areas which required the attention of the Accounting Officer, and reports as follows:</p>
          <p>2. Receivables for departmental revenue</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) The receivables for departmental revenue balance of R72,2 million (2010: R72,5 million) included in disclosure note 24 to the financial statements, is misstated as a result of omissions in respect of payments received and not recorded, amounts due not being raised and incorrect interest calculations on outstanding balances. The Department did not identify and correct all the errors that exist in the balance as a result the extent of the error cannot be determined. The Department's records did not allow for the performance of alternative audit procedures to satisfy the Auditor-General of the receivables for departmental revenue. Consequently, there was insufficient appropriate audit evidence to satisfy the Auditor-General as to the existence, completeness, valuation and allocation of and rights pertaining to the receivables for departmental revenue balance.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) The Department implements a system to assist in the accounting for these transactions, and the system should automatically calculate the outstanding balances at financial year end, including the correct interest for the period; b) Schedules are reviewed on a monthly basis to ensure the information captured is accurate and complete; and c) Officials responsible for capturing payments and keeping records should be held accountable for these omissions.</p>
          <p>3. Revenue</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) The Department could not provide sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support journal entries of R50.4 million debited to revenue. The journal entries were based on total receipts from royalty debtors without reconciling the payments received to outstanding debt balances thereby understating the revenue amount. Further, the credit entries in the revenue account include receipts from prospecting fees that have not been appropriately reconciled to outstanding receivables balances. There were no satisfactory alternative audit procedures that could be performed to obtain reasonable assurance that all revenue was properly recorded. Consequently, sufficient appropriate audit evidence was not obtained to satisfy the auditors as to the completeness, accuracy and classification of revenue of R30.3 million.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) The journal entries are scrutinised to identify the amounts that have been incorrectly journalised; b) The incorrect entries representing revenue funds that have already been surrendered and amounts sourced from the receivables schedules are reversed; and c) Officials responsible for journal entries and record keeping be held accountable for lack of audit evidence for journal entries 4. Payables</p>
          <p>The Auditor- General reported the following:</p>
          <p>a) Due to the limitations identified under Revenue, the Auditor-General was unable to conclude on the existence, completeness, valuation and allocation of and obligations pertaining to the payables balance to the amount of R53,5 million. The Department's records did not permit the application of alternative audit procedures regarding the payables balances.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) The journal entries are scrutinised to identify the amounts that have been incorrectly journalised; b) The incorrect entries representing revenue funds that have already been surrendered and amounts sourced from the receivables schedules are reversed; and c) Officials responsible for journal entries and record keeping be held accountable for lack of audit evidence for journal entries.</p>
          <p>5. Provisions</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) Included in note 29, impairments and other provisions, to the financial statements are receivables for departmental receivables revenue debt balances that are outstanding for longer than three years amounting to R36,3 million (2010: R36,5 million), which the department impairs in accordance with its policy on impairments. Sufficient appropriate audit evidence could not be obtained to conclude on the existence, completeness, valuation and allocation and obligations of the other provisions balance due to the limitation reported in receivables for departmental revenue debt balance.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) The Department implements a system to assist in the accounting for these transactions, and the system should automatically calculate the outstanding balances at financial year end, including the correct interest for the period; b) Schedules are reviewed on a monthly basis to ensure the information captured is accurate and complete; and c) Officials responsible for journal entries and record keeping be held accountable for lack of audit evidence for journal entries.</p>
          <p>6. Contingent liabilities</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) The contingent liabilities, as disclosed in note 19 to the financial statements, include the Department's obligations in respect of abandoned mines. The Department is and has been conducting rehabilitation activities in respect of abandoned mined in accordance with the National Strategy for the Management of Derelict and Ownerless Mines in South Africa. The Department is still in the process of establishing a financial estimate of the liability with the result that management has taken a decision not to disclose a provision in this regard. The Department's records did not permit the application of alternative audit procedures regarding its obligation in respect of abandoned mines. Consequently, there was insufficient appropriate audit evidence to satisfy the Auditor-General as to the existence, completeness and valuation of the contingent liabilities and the corresponding impact on the provisions balance.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) Management develops a methodology that will assist in identifying accounting estimates and valuation approaches suitable for assessing environmental liability; b) Significant judgements and estimates that are developed are documented and supported by verifiable source information; and c) Officials responsible for journal entries and record keeping be held accountable for lack of audit evidence for journal entries.</p>
          <p>7. Conclusion</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts recommends that the Executive Authority submits a progress report on the implementation of the above recommendations to the National Assembly within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House.</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts further recommends that the Accounting Officer submits quarterly reports on all the above-mentioned recommendations. Report to be considered.</p>

          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts (the Committee) heard evidence on and considered the content of the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor- General (A-G) on the 2010/11 financial statements of the Department of Labour (the Department). The Committee noted the unqualified audit opinion, highlighted areas which required the attention of the Accounting Officer, and reports as follows:</p>
          <p>2. Compliance with laws and regulations</p>
          <p>2.1 Procurement and contract management</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General (AG) identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) The Department did not comply in certain circumstances with National Treasury Practice Note 8 of 2007-08 for transactions between R10 000 and R500 000 and those exceeding R500 000 (VAT included), as the Accounting Officer did not invite written quotations or competitive bids respectively as required; b) In certain instances awards were made to suppliers who did not submit a declaration on whether they are employed by the state or connected to any person employed by the state as per the requirements of Treasury regulation 16A8.2 and Practice Note 7 of 2009/10; and c) In certain instances awards were made to suppliers who did not submit a declaration of past supply chain practices such as fraud, abuse and non performance as per the requirements of Treasury regulation 16A9.1(a) and Practice Note 4 of 2006.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures the following:</p>
          <p>a) The Department follows at all times Treasury Regulations and Practice Notes in the awarding of bids; b) There are regular reviews of supply chain management activities to ensure compliance; and c) Officials who approved bids that did not comply with legal prescripts are held accountable.</p>
          <p>2.2 Human Resource Management and compensation The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) The Accounting Officer did not ensure that performance assessments of senior managers were conducted during the year as required by Public Service Regulations paragraph B1; and b) The Accounting Officer did not ensure that funded vacant posts were filled within 12 months after becoming vacant as per the requirements of Public Service Regulation C.1A.2.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures the following:</p>
          <p>a) Funded vacant posts are filled timeously; and b) The Human Resource Unit ensures that performance assessments are performed at all levels and makes follow up where evidence is not provided.</p>
          <p>The Committee further recommends that the Executive Authority takes action against the Accounting Officer for contravening Public Service Regulations (paragraph B1 and C.1A.2).</p>
          <p>2.3 Expenditure Management</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) The Accounting Officer did not take effective and appropriate steps to prevent and detect irregular expenditure as per the requirements of section 38 (1) (c) (ii) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and Treasury Regulation 9.1.1. The Department incurred irregular expenditure due to procurement procedures that were not always adhered to; b) The Accounting Officer did not ensure that all payments due to creditors are settled within 30 days from receipt of an invoice as per the requirement of section 38 (1) (f) of the PFMA and Treasury Regulation 8.2.3; and c) The Accounting Officer did not ensure that the public private partnership (PPP) agreement is properly implemented, managed, enforced, monitored, and reported on as required by Treasury Regulations, paragraph 16.7.1.</p>

A significant number of minor assets were recorded in the asset register without locations and barcodes. The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that:</p>
          <p>Monthly reviews of the asset register are done so as to make certain that it is updated with all the relevant details regarding additions, disposals and movement.</p>
          <p>The Committee further recommends that the Executive Authority should take action against the Accounting Officer for contravening section 38 (1) (d) of the PFMA, as well as Treasury Regulation 10.1.1.</p>
          <p>3. Sheltered Employment Factories</p>
          <p>3.1 Introduction</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts (the Committee) heard evidence on and considered the content of the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor- General (A-G) on the 2010/11 financial statements of the Sheltered Employment Factories (SEF). The Committee noted the qualified audit opinion, highlighted areas which required the attention of the Accounting Officer, and reports as follows:</p>
          <p>3.2 Operating leases</p>
          <p>The Auditor- General identified the following:</p>
          <p>The entity did not disclose the minimum future lease payment for the operating lease commitment for the current period under review as well as for the prior period (2010). The A-G was unable to confirm or verify by alternative means the completeness, valuation, rights and obligations of the lease payable as well as the completeness and accuracy of the related lease expense and the corresponding lease payable.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures the following:</p>
          <p>d) The entity's management makes certain that the prior period errors are retrospectively corrected as required by International Accounting Standards (IAS) 8; and e) The entity's management makes certain that future minimum lease payments are disclosed in its annual financial statements to comply with the requirements of IAS 17.</p>
          <p>3.3 Inventories</p>
          <p>The Auditor- General identified the following:</p>
          <p>During the inventory count, material variances between counts of inventory on hand and the accounting records were identified. Furthermore, an assessment of the stage of completion of work in progress at 31 March 2011 was not done. The entity's records did not permit the application of alternative audit procedures regarding inventories. Consequently, the A-G did not obtain all the information and explanations considered necessary to verify the existence and completeness of inventories amounting to</p>

        <debateSection id="dbs65" name="r993000">
          <heading id="dbsh65">R993000.</heading>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that the following:</p>
          <p>The entity's management makes certain that all the designed internal controls are implemented and adhered to by all personnel, through the assigning of oversight responsibilities.</p>
          <p>3.4. Cost of sales</p>
          <p>The Auditor- General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) Included in the prior period (2010) figure for cost sales is a movement of R1.5 million relating to direct labour and manufacturing overhead costs. These costs were allocated to the opening balances of inventory for the prior period (2010) figure using a historic allocation rate. The A-G was unable to obtain the assumptions made to determine the reasonableness of the rate used; and b) Costs relating to the production of items sold during the prior year have been incorrectly classified as operating expenditure. As a result, cost sales is understated by R1.839 million.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer should ensure that:</p>
          <p>The entity's management makes certain that the prior period errors are retrospectively corrected as required by IAS 8.</p>
          <p>3.5 Property, plant and equipment</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) Assets with a cost below R3 000 (minor assets), with a gross carrying amount of R3.553 million were not recognised but expensed in the year of acquisition; and b) Assets with an estimated value of R180 000 which are still in use are still not recorded in the prior year's accounting records. Consequently, prior year property, plant and equipment as disclosed in note 6 to the financial statements is understated by R3.732 million.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that:</p>
          <p>The entity's management makes certain that the prior period errors are retrospectively corrected as required by IAS 8.</p>
          <p>4. Conclusion</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts recommends that the Executive Authority submits a progress report on the implementation of all the above recommendations to the National Assembly within 60 days of the adoption of this report by the House.</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts is concerned that on a number of findings by the AG it was the Accounting Officer who directly failed to fulfil certain responsibilities. The Committee views this in a serious light and calls for more stringent political oversight action in this regard.</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts further recommends that the Accounting Officer submits quarterly reports on all the above-mentioned recommendations.</p>

          <heading id="dbsh70">AUDITOR-GENERAL ON THE ANNUAL REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BOXING SOUTH AFRICA FOR THE 2010/11 FINANCIAL YEAR, DATED 22 AUGUST 2012</heading>
          <p>1. Introduction</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts (the Committee) heard evidence on and considered the content of the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor- General (AG) on the 2010/11 financial statements of Boxing South Africa (BSA). The Committee noted the qualified audit opinion, highlighted areas which required the attention of the Accounting Authority, and reports as follows:</p>
          <p>2. Trade and other payables</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) The entity could not provide sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an amount of R324 026 included in trade and other payables. There were no satisfactory alternative audit procedures that the AG could perform to obtain reasonable assurance that all trade and other payables were adequately recorded. Consequently, the AG could not satisfy himself as to the existence, completeness, rights and obligations and valuation of trade and other payables; and b) Included in trade and other payables is an amount of R518 515 relating to insurance received in advance. The Standard of Generally Recognised Accounting Practice, GRAP 19, Provisions, Contingent liabilities and contingent assets, requires the amount recognised as a provision to be stated at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. GRAP 19 further states that provisions shall be reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. The entity did not review insurance received in advance on 31 March 2011, as required by GRAP 19.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures the following:</p>
          <p>a) Management implements proper record keeping system that complies with all reporting requirements; b) The financial statements and other information is included in the annual report and be reviewed for completeness and accuracy prior to submission for audit; and c) Officials be held accountable for not safekeeping and submitting accurate information for audit purposes.</p>
          <p>3. Restatement of corresponding figures</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following: Misstatements in the corresponding figures were identified during the audit of the financial statements for the current year relating to finance lease obligations and the opening balance of the insurance asset. Management corrected these misstatements by restating the corresponding figure for finance lease obligations and the insurance asset as disclosed in note 1.17 to the financial statements.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that: The financial statements and other information included in the annual report are checked and reviewed for completeness and accuracy prior to audit. All amendments to financial statements and information are effected before the annual audit commences.</p>
          <p>4. Going concern</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>Note 21 to the financial statements indicates that Boxing SA incurred a net deficit of R2 709 332 during the year ended 31 March 2011 and, as of that date, the entity's liabilities exceeded its total assets by R6 248 040. These conditions, along with other matters set forth in note 21 indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>A comprehensive turnaround strategy is urgently developed with clear performance indicators to deal with the financial challenges of the entity.</p>
          <p>5. Irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) As disclosed in note 23 to the financial statements, irregular expenditure to the amount of R720 308 was incurred as the entity failed to comply with Supply Chain Management Regulations; and b) As disclosed in note 22 to the financial statements, fruitless and wasteful expenditure to the amount of R1 603 809 was incurred as a result of the following: . The entity failed to comply with its internal policies and procedures regarding insurance claim payments; . Interest and penalties were incurred as a result of late payment on amounts owed to the South African Revenue Service and the Auditor General of South Africa; and . The human resource function was outsourced even though Boxing SA staff received training to perform the function themselves.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures the following:</p>
          <p>a) Officials follow the Supply Chain Management processes so as to avoid the recurrence of irregular expenditure; b) Disciplinary action is taken against employees who were responsible for incurring such irregular, fruitless and wasteful exenditure as required by Section 51 (e) (iii) of the PFMA; c) Policies, procedures and procedural manuals that guide the day-to-day operation of the entity are implemented accordingly; and d) SARS is paid timeously to ensure that no interest is incurred. 6. Material Losses</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following: As disclosed in note 24 to the financial statements, material losses to the amount of R132 335 were incurred as a result of shortfalls between cash received for license fees and cash banked.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that:</p>
          <p>Disciplinary measures be taken against officials who did not follow the policies and procedures.</p>
          <p>7. Compliance with laws and regulations</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) The accounting authority did not finalise and submit a strategic plan to the relevant executive authority on or before 1 April as required by Treasury Regulation 30.1.1 and 30.1.2; and b) The accounting authority did not ensure that the public entity has and maintained an effective, efficient and transparent system of internal control regarding performance management, which described and represented how the entity's processes of performance planning, monitoring, measurement, review and reporting were conducted, organised and managed as required by section 51(1)(a)(i) of the PFMA.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>The entity strengthens its internal control systems to ensure compliance with strategic planning laws and regulations as required by Treasury Regulation 30.1.1 and 30.1.2.</p>
          <p>8. Conclusion</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts recommends that the Executive Authority submits a progress report on all the recommendations to the National Assembly within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House.</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts further recommends that the Accounting Authority submits quarterly reports on all the above-mentioned recommendations.</p>

          <heading id="dbsh74">AUDITOR-GENERAL ON THE ANNUAL REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NATIONAL ARTS COUNCIL FOR THE 2010/11 FINANCIAL YEAR, DATED 22 AUGUST 2012</heading>
          <p>1. Introduction The Committee on Public Accounts (the Committee) heard evidence on and considered the contents of the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor- General on the 2010/11 financial statements of the National Arts Council (NAC). The Committee noted the qualified audit opinion, highlighted areas which required the urgent attention of the Accounting Authority, and reports as follows:</p>
          <p>2. Non-current asset held for transfer</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>Non-current assets held for transfer was disclosed in terms of the SA Standards of Generally Recognised Accounting Practise (GRAP), GRAP 100, Non- current assets held for sale. However these assets were not measured in accordance with the accounting policy and SA Standards of GRAP, GRAP17, Property, plant and equipment which requires that an item of property, plant and equipment should be carried at the revalued amount less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. As indicated in note 27 to the financial statements, no depreciation was provided for on the non-current asset held for transfer. Had depreciation been provided for, the surplus for the period would have been stated at R5 759 347 (2010: R31 958 239); non-current asset held for transfer would have been reduced by an accumulated depreciation of R2 690 760 (2010: R1 345 380), and the accumulated surplus would have been decreased by the same amount.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that: The accounting treatment relating to Downtown Studios should be in line with the recommendations by National Treasury, i.e. Disclosure GRAP 100 and measurement GRAP 17.</p>
          <p>3. Revenue from non-exchange transaction</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>Contrary to the requirements of the SA Standards of GRAP, GRAP 23, revenue from non-exchange transactions which require that non-exchange revenue must be recognised when the present obligation was met, non-exchange revenue was not recognised although the present obligation in terms of the memorandum of understanding with the National Department of Arts and Culture was met. As indicated in note 27 to the financial statements, liabilities directly associated with the non-current assets held for transfer were not reduced in accordance with the requirements of GRAP 23. Had revenue been recognised, the liabilities associated with the non-current assets held for transfer would have been reduced byR4 792 822 (2010: R4 792 822), and accumulated surpluses would have been increased by the same amount.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>Management takes responsibility for the accounting treatment for revenue received from grant funding in terms of GRAP 23.</p>
          <p>4. Business combination and consolidated financial statements</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following: The purchase of the business as disclosed in note 30 was not correctly accounted for in accordance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards(IFRS 3), Business Combination and the SA Standards of GRAP,GRAP 6, consolidated and separate financial statements. This resulted in accounts payable being understated by R3 382 597 (2010: R3 209 505), cash and cash equivalents overstated by R455 305 (2010: understated by R3 191 565) and the accumulated surplus being understated by</p>

          <heading id="dbsh75">R440 862.</heading>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>Management takes ownership to ensure that the accounting treatment relating to the purchase of Downtown Studio's should be in terms of requirements of GRAP 6 and IFRS 3.</p>
          <p>5. Restatement of corresponding figures</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>As disclosed in note 35 to the financial statements, the corresponding figures for 31 March 2010 were restated as a result of an error discovered during 31 March 2011 in the financial statements of the National Arts Council of South Africa at, and for the year ended, 31 March 2010.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>Financial statements and other information included in the annual report are checked and reviewed for completeness and accuracy prior to audit. All amendments to financial statements and information are effected before the annual audit commences. 6. Compliance with laws and regulations</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>The financial statements submitted for audit did not comply with section 55(1) (b) of the PFMA. Material misstatements were identified during the audit and some were corrected by management.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>Management implements a process whereby financial statements presented for audit are independently reviewed by internal audit to identify errors, omissions and misstatements prior to submission to the Auditor-General for audit purposes.</p>
          <p>7. Expenditure management</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) As disclosed in note 17 to the financial statements, the public entity incurred fruitless and wasteful expenditure amounting to R585 094 in respect of an unfair dismissal of an employee and recruitment services that did not yield results. The expenditure incurred was contrary to section 51(1)(b)(ii) of the PFMA; and b) As disclosed in note 17 to the financial statements, the public entity incurred irregular expenditure amounting to R10 984 973 as the expenditure incurred was in contravention of section 54(2)(d) of the PFMA relating to obtaining approval from the executive authority for the acquisition of a significant asset. The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures the following: a) Management takes responsibility and provides adequate guidance to officials in assisting management to exercise reasonable care so as to avoid fruitless and wasteful expenditure from being incurred in future periods; b) The entity strengthens its internal control environment in order to avoid incurring further irregular expenditure; and c) Disciplinary action is taken against employees who were responsible for incurring such irregular expenditure as required by Section 51 (e) (iii) of the PFMA.</p>
          <p>8. Procurement and contract management</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>As disclosed in note 17 to the financial statements, the public entity incurred irregular expenditure amounting to R2 797 093 as the expenditure incurred was in contravention of the supply chain management policy and section 51(1) (b) (ii) of the PFMA.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures the following:</p>
          <p>a) Officials follow supply chain management processes when they procure goods and services so as to avoid recurring irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure; and b) Management hold officials accountable for such irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure.</p>
          <p>9. Conclusion</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts recommends that the Executive Authority submits a progress report on the implementation of the above recommendations to the National Assembly within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House.</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts further recommends that the Accounting Authority submits quarterly reports on all the above-mentioned recommendations.</p>

          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following: Sufficient appropriate evidence could not be provided to support fruitless and wasteful expenditure amounting to R344 889. The entity's record did not permit the application of alternative audit procedures regarding the fruitless and wasteful expenditure recognised. Consequently, sufficient appropriate audit evidence to the occurrence, completeness and accuracy of fruitless and wasteful expenditure of R344 889 could not be obtained.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) Procedures for claims for travel, subsistence and transport should be adhered to; b) Proper documentation is kept; and c) Disciplinary action is taken against employees who were responsible for incurring fruitless and wasteful expenditure as required by Section 51 (e) (iii) of the PFMA</p>

The entity's records did not permit the application of alternative audit procedures regarding the ageing of trade and other receivables. There was no evidence to support the accuracy of ageing of trade receivables amounting to R419 351.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) Management monitors action plans to ensure that prior year issues are being followed up and cleared so that ageing information is correctly reported on the system.; and b) Proper record keeping system is in place.</p>
          <p>4. Cash flow statement</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified identified the following:</p>
          <p>The presentation of a cash flow statement, summarising the entity's operating activities, is required by the Standard of Generally Recognised Accounting Practice (GRAP 2), cash flow statements. The cash flow as at 31 March 2011 received from government and other is understated by R2 848 000 (2010: R 468 000) and cash paid to suppliers and employees is understated by R2 848 000 .</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) Competent and suitably skilled individuals who understand the requirements of GRAP are appointed; and b) Management is held accountable for submitting reliable and accurate information.</p>
          <p>5. Restatement of corresponding figures</p>

          <p>As disclosed in note 27 to the financial statements, the corresponding figures for 31 March 2010 have been restated as a result of errors discovered during 2010/11 in the financial statements of the South African Heritage Resources Agency at, and for the year ended, 31 March 2010.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) Financial statements are reviewed by appropriately delegated officials prior to them being submitted for audit so as to comply with the PFMA and Treasury Regulations; and b) All amendments to financial statements and information are effected before the annual audit commences.</p>
          <p>6. Compliance with laws and regulations</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) The Accounting Authority did not submit the financial statements for auditing within two months after the end of the financial year as required by section 55(1) of the PFMA; b) The audit committee did not function as per the requirements of section 77 of the PFMA and Treasury Regulation 27.1 in that the audit committee was not constituted correctly and half of the audit committee members consisted of executive members appointed by the accounting authority; and c) The Accounting Authority submitted financial statements for auditing that were not prepared in all material aspects in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices and supported by full and proper records as required by section 55(1) (a) and (b) of the PFMA. Material misstatements identified by the AGSA were not all subsequently corrected adequately which resulted in the financial statements receiving a qualified audit opinion in contravention of section 55 (2)(a).</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) All amendments to financial statements and information are effected before the annual audit commences; and b) Management complies with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
          <p>7. Expenditure management</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified that:</p>
          <p>The Accounting Authority did not take effective and appropriate steps to prevent irregular expenditure as per the requirements of section 51(1)(b) of the PFMA as irregular expenditure of R13 086 000, as disclosed in note 26 to the financial statements, has been incurred.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) The Entity improves its monitoring system so as to address challenges of poor financial reporting, compliance with legislation and the adequacy of performance information; b) A complete, accurate and valid register of irregular expenditure incurred be maintained throughout the year and be made available for audit purposes; c) Proper financial controls are developed and implemented to avoid incurring irregular expenditure; and d) Disciplinary action is taken against officials who are responsible for incurring such irregular expenditure.</p>
          <p>8. Conclusion</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts recommends that the Executive Authority submits a progress report on the implementation of the above recommendations to the National Assembly within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House.</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts further recommends that the Accounting Authority submits quarterly reports on all the above-mentioned recommendations.</p>

          <p>1. Introduction</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts (the Committee) heard evidence on and considered the contents of the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor- General on the 2010/11 financial statements of the Public Service SETA (PSETA). The Committee noted the disclaimer opinion, highlighted areas which required the urgent attention of the Accounting Authority, and reports as follows: 2. Going Concern</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) With reference to note 23 to the financial statements, the entity's current liabilities exceeded its total assets by R19.9 million. This condition, along with other matters as set forth in note 23, indicates the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to operate as a going concern; and b) With reference to note 23 to the financial statements, the PSETA's licence was renewed by the Department of Higher Education and Training until 31 March 2012. At the date of the report, the licence had not been extended.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>Management monitors the implementation of the plan that addresses going concern matters and does a follow-up with the Department of Higher Education and Training with regard to the extension of the licence.</p>
          <p>3. Irregular expenditure</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>As a result of the prior period error disclosed in note 16.2 to the current annual financial statements, irregular expenditure of R6.1 million was incurred, as disclosed in note 13.1.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures the following:</p>
          <p>a) The entity strengthens its internal control environment in order to avoid further recurring of irregular expenditure; and b) Disciplinary action is taken against employees who were responsible for incurring such irregular expenditure as required by Section 51 (e) (iii) of the PFMA</p>
          <p>4. Restatement of corresponding figures</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) With reference to notes 16.1 and 16.2 to the financial statements, the corresponding figures for 31 March 2010 have been restated. Misstatements in the corresponding figures were identified during the audit of the financial statements of the 2009-10 financial year relating to accounts receivable amounting to R6.3 million (2008-09: R2.8 million). Management corrected the misstatement by restating the corresponding figures and opening balances; and b) With reference to note 16.3 to the financial statements, the corresponding figures for March 2010 and prior years have been restated. Accounts payables were restated to reflect information that became available in the current year with regard to the NSF deferred income liability.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures the following:</p>
          <p>a) All necessary amendments to the financial statements and information are effected before the annual audit commences; b) Misstatements are corrected by management; and c) Management is held accountable for submitting inaccurate and unreliable information to the auditors.</p>
          <p>5. Compliance with laws and regulations</p>
          <p>The Auditor-General identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) Contrary to the requirements of section 51(1)(a)(i) of the PFMA and Treasury Regulation 27.2.1,specific sector policies and procedures regarding inventory, grants and predetermined objectives that are critical for the operations of the SETA had not been developed and/or approved; b) Contrary to the requirements of section 55(1) (a) of the PFMA the financial statements submitted by the accounting authority on 31 May 2011 were not accurately presented and prepared and were subject to material changes; c) Contrary to the requirements of Treasury Regulation 11.4, bad debts were written off without the authorisation of the accounting authority as prescribed by the PSETA's finance policy; d) Contrary to the requirements of section 51(1) (a) (i) of the PFMA and Treasury Regulation 27.2.1, the PSETA's risk assessment was drafted but not approved during the year; and e) Contrary to the requirements of section 51(1)(a)(ii) of the PFMA and Treasury Regulation 27.1.6,the audit committee's audit charter and terms of reference were drafted but not approved by the Accounting Authority.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures the following:</p>
          <p>a) All the movements in the accounting records are supported by the relevant supporting documentation; b) Management provides supporting documentation to support the administration expenses recognised in the administration reserve; c) Management report to the Accounting Authority on a regular basis whether laws and regulations are being complied with and this should be verified by internal audit; and d) Financial statements are reviewed by appropriate delegated levels prior to them being submitted for audit so as to comply with the PFMA and Treasury Regulations</p>
          <p>6. Conclusion</p>

          <heading id="dbsh81">AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF TRANSNET AND THE REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS ON THE 2010/11 FINANCIAL YEAR, DATED 23 MAY 2012</heading>
          <p>1. Introduction The Committee on Public Accounts (the Committee) heard evidence on and considered the contents of the Annual Report and the Report of the Independent Auditors on the 2010/11 financial statements of Transnet (the entity). The Committee noted the unqualified audit opinion, highlighted areas which required the attention of the Accounting Authority, and reports as follows:</p>
          <p>2. Procurement, contract and expenditure management</p>
          <p>The Independent Auditors identified the following:</p>
          <p>a) Fruitless and wasteful expenditure of R36 million on the procurement of a Pneumatic Ship Unloader; and b) Irregular expenditure of R8.3 billion, which arose as a result of non- compliance with group policies and procedures, relating to: . Contracts for the provision of Engineering, Procurement and Contract Management (EPCM) services on capital projects; . Contracts for the supply of 32 Rubber Tyre Gantry (RTG) cranes; . Contracts for the accommodation of staff; and . Contracts for the supply of rails.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures that:</p>
          <p>a) Internal controls are strengthened and monitored continuously to ensure compliance with group policies and procedures; b) Internal controls are reported on in the annual audit processes; c) The disciplinary processes against the eight employees who were found to have been responsible for the wasteful expenditure of R36 million be finalised timeously; and d) The relevant policies are reviewed to prevent employees who had mismanaged company resources from resigning before they face the appropriate disciplinary action.</p>
          <p>3. Conclusion</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts notes the submission by the entity on materiality limits of up to R25 million that are not included in the financial statements for audit purposes. The Committee on Public Accounts awaits a written report on the matter, which will be considered in due course.</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts recommends that the Executive Authority submits a progress report on all the above recommendations to the National Assembly within 60 days after the adoption of this report by the House.</p>
          <p>The Committee on Public Accounts further recommends that the Accounting Authority submits quarterly reports on all the above-mentioned recommendations.</p>
          <p>Report to be considered.</p>
          <p>13. Report of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development on the Request from the Public Protector in terms of section 2(5) of the Public Protector Act. No 23 of 1994 for the National Assembly to review and re-determine the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment of the Deputy Public Protector, dated 19 September 2012</p>
          <p>The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development, having considered the request from the Public Protector in terms of section 2(5) of the Public Protector Act, No. 23 of 1994 for the National Assembly to review and re-determine the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment of the Deputy Public Protector, reports as follows:</p>
          <p>1. On the recommendation of the National Assembly, the President appointed the Deputy Public Protector (DPP) with effect from 1 December 2005 for a period of seven years. At that time, in accordance with the Public Protector Act, No. 23 of 1994, the National Assembly, on the advice of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development, determined the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment of the Deputy Public Protector.</p>
          <p>2. The Committee learnt that, in 2007, the former Public Protector revised the Deputy Public Protector's salary. The Committee has also learnt that the DPP has received inflationary linked annual increases.</p>
          <p>3. The issue of disparities in remuneration and conditions of service is not only peculiar to the Office of the Public Protector but has also been raised by other Chapter 9 institutions. The Committee is informed that legislation is planned to require the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers to make recommendations relating to the salaries, allowances and benefits of the Public Protector and members of any commission provided for in the Constitution, as required in terms of section 219(5) of the Constitution. The Committee welcomes this legislation and urges that it be brought as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>4. The Committee, therefore, recommends that the remuneration and conditions of service of the Deputy Public Protector is not re-determined at this time, but that the revision that took place in 2007 by the then Public Protector is condoned.</p>

          <heading id="dbsh83">AMENDMENT PROCEDURE AND RELATED MATTERS ACT, ACT NO. 9 OF 2009, DATED 19 SEPTEMBER 2012</heading>
          <p>The Standing Committee on Finance reports as follows:</p>
          <p>1. Introduction and Background</p>
          <p>On 24 May 2012 the National Assembly, citing technical challenges that have become apparent during the implementation of the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act, Act No. 9 of 2009 (the Act), passed a resolution, instructing the Standing Committee on Finance (the Committee) to review the Act with a view to introduce amending legislation if necessary.</p>
          <p>The resolution of the Assembly requires the Committee to:</p>
          <p>a) evaluate the application of the legislation including, but not limited to, the timeframes and sequencing associated with the different financial instruments and bills, the procedures to be developed in the rules; and the functions and management of the Parliamentary Budget Office;</p>
          <p>b) report on any other matter related to the implementation of the Act;</p>
          <p>c) confer with the Standing Committee on Appropriations; and</p>
          <p>d) report to the National Assembly on progress by 21 September 2012.</p>
          <p>2. Progress</p>
          <p>After the Act came into operation, the Presiding Officers appointed a Task Team to facilitate the implementation of the Act. The Task Team identified challenges and proposed solutions in giving effect to the purpose of the Act. The Committee were briefed on these challenges and solutions. In this respect the Committee was advised as follows: The Act provides for time frames and sequencing in respect of the following:</p>
          <p>. Budgetary Review and Recommendation Reports (BRRR) (section 5);</p>
          <p>. Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (section 6); and</p>
          <p>. Fiscal Framework, Division of Revenue Bill and Appropriation Bill (sections 7 - 10).</p>
          <p>The question is whether these requirements are reasonable and practical?</p>
          <p>The Act requires co-ordination between committees in fulfilling their mandates during the budget process in respect of the following:</p>
          <p>. BRRR (section 4(5));</p>
          <p>. Appropriation Bill (section 10(8)); and</p>
          <p>. Adjustments budget (section 12(16)).</p>
          <p>The question is how the process envisaged in the Act can be regulated practically in the rules? This issue will have to be considered in light of possible amendments to the Act.</p>
          <p>Section 15 of the Act establishes the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) and sets out the following:</p>
          <p>. functions (section 15(2));</p>
          <p>. appointment and removal of director (sections 15(5) &amp; ((8));</p>
          <p>. budget as a transfer (section 15(10)); and</p>
          <p>. management of PBO (sections 15(12)-15)).</p>
          <p>The challenge here is how to align the provisions of the Act that are necessary to give effect to establishing the PBO with the provisions of the Financial Management of Parliament Act, 2009 (Act No. 10 of 2009) (FMPA). The FMPA was passed after the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act. The functioning and management of the PBO must take into account the roles of the Executive Authority and the Accounting Officer as provided for in the FMPA. Prof M Jahed, seconded from the Development Bank of Southern Africa, has been mandated to assist with the establishment of the PBO.</p>
          <p>Section 16 of the Act, read with the Schedule to the Act, provides for norms and standards for provincial legislatures. Section 120(3) of the Constitution provides that provincial legislatures must pass provincial legislation to set out a procedure to amend provincial money Bills. Section 116(1) of the Constitution provides that a provincial legislature may control and determine its internal arrangements, proceedings and procedures. Section 16 of the Act must be reviewed to ensure that it is consistent with the Constitution.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the Committee was advised that the language used in the Act can be improved to be consistent with language used in parliamentary processes (e.g. definitions), to effect certain corrections (e.g. section 11(4)(c)) and to delete certain obsolete provisions (e.g. section 3).</p>
          <p>3. Way forward</p>
          <p>The Standing Committee on Finance resolved to workshop proposed amendments to the Act with all stakeholders on a future convenient date. The Committee will include all Finance cluster Committees in the process going forward once dates have been determined.</p>
