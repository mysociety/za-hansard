   "text": "Ms A Steyn (DA) commented that although there were many animal health technologists in the communal areas, there was little basic health equipment, limited vehicles, limited transport, vaccinations were not kept cold while being transported to the farm animals during the day, and various other problems. She also noted that many animals were heavily infested with ticks. At a communal farm in Sterkspruit, the animal health technician merely arrived, filled the animal dips and left, without checking the animals for ticks. While money could bring in rams, bulls, fences and boreholes, the NERPO projects should start from the beginning and look at existing capacity and basic requirements on the ground."

   "text": "The Chairperson suggested that NERPO and DAFF should return to the Committee with a clear plan on how they would collaborate with other state entities and departments so that DAFF did not \u201cre-invent the wheel\u201d. NERPO was about the need for sustainable support, and there had to be tangible implementation of the plan. DAFF needed to establish the status of each livestock farm before intervention, to compare the results pre and post project."

   "text": "Ms N Phaliso (ANC) was concerned that provinces were not spending their allocations and that outreach programmes had no money for emerging farmers. She was concerned that the Northern Cape did not attend the provincial meetings on spending of funds."
