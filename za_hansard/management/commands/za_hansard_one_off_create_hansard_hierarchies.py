# This is a one-off script that will search for any sections that appear to be
# from Hansard and that are not a sub-section of something else. This will
# change the database to match what would have been the case had the changes in
# https://github.com/mysociety/za-hansard/commit/aa8dd4df31062049b33304a1a7c3011
# 13505773d been in place when the processing was first done. As the processing
# is so slow it is much easier to alter the database than to re-run the
# scraping.
