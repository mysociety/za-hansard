   "text": "The Chairperson said the Committee would receive a presentation from the National Emergent Red-Meat Producers Organisation (NERPO), who had requested a meeting. It would have been better if the other relevant committees from portfolios such as energy and water had been included in the meeting. If one looked at the input costs NERPO had raised, they required a multi-departmental hearing."

   "text": "Mr L Gaehler (UDM) commented the Committee had been receiving presentations on a number of schemes, but their results were not visible on the ground. Millions were spent on these different schemes. Could the NERPO delegation explain what a communal farmer was, and if they could indicate the kind of livestock such farmers had. What assistance could the organisation give to such farmers to improve the quality of their breed."

   "party": "ANC", 
   "text": "Mr S Abram (ANC) commented that the Committee was aware there were issues because little had been done by DAFF, otherwise NERPO would not have been in Parliament. Society depended on the state, and without society there were no state institutions. The state was duty bound to disburse services, if that did not happen, members of the public were indeed correct to approach Parliament for redress. The question was would the redress come?"

   "party": "ANC", 
   "text": "Ms M Pilusa-Mosoane (ANC) said people were suffering on the ground, and such a situation required listening executive leadership. The challenge was that national government was non-responsive to the challenges of the people. Responsive leadership was mainly found at provinces where community challenges were addressed within hours. Provinces were much better, and communication happened on the ground. Why was it so difficult to work with national departments?"

   "text": "Mr P Ngwenya-Mabila (ANC) explained that the report pertained to the strategic plan and the annual performance plan (APP) which informed the direction the Department would take this financial year. What the Minister, Richard Baloyi, would present in the House would be related to the report. The budget vote would be in line with this report on the APP that had been presented. The report contained the activities that the Department would perform in this financial year. This was the reason the Committee adopted the report."
