          <speech by="#mr-g-j-selau">
            <from>Mr G J SELAU</from>
            <p>Mr Speaker, we wish to say that we have not come here today to praise the hon Mavis Matladi, but to be part of the motion of condolence for her. May her soul rest in peace. I feel honoured that the ANC, the ruling party in the Republic of South Africa, the oldest liberation movement in Africa, requested me to participate in this motion of condolence for the hon Mavis Ntebaleng Matladi, the leader of the UCDP, who passed away on 2 December 2011. She was buried on 9 December 2011 at Lehurutshe and her funeral service was held at the Lehurutshe Civic Centre. I was present at that funeral.</p>
            <p>In the run-up to the last local government election, we worked against each other as competing parties at the Ramotshere Moiloa Local Municipality. I visited the UCDP offices in Zeerust, which are not far from the ANC offices, with the aim of challenging the UCDP in all wards. Unfortunately, I could not find her at the offices. Later on, I went to her house in Lehurutshe township, commonly known as Welgedacht, and found the gate open. I could not enter the premises because her well-trained dogs were there and fighting. [Laughter.] I met her only after the elections, in which the ANC had won all the wards in that municipality.</p>
            <p>The hon Mavis Ntebaleng Matladi was a rising star, not only in the politics of the UCDP or the politics of South Africa, but also in the politics of the continent of Africa and the world at large. As a member of the National Assembly of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, she was one of the five members deployed to represent South Africa at the Pan-African Parliament, where she was elected president of the Women's Caucus. Though the UCDP is an opposition party, both in the National Assembly and in the North West province, the style of debate that has been left to the UCDP by the hon Matladi is that of not opposing for the sake of opposing, but using their platform to make the ruling party see the other side of the coin before making decisions. That is effective opposition-party activity. We call on the UCDP and all other parties in this House to continue recognising her style.</p>
            <p>The hon Mavis Matladi was an effective, influential and smart political debater. I never gave up recruiting her to the ANC. I regret that she left us before I could win that battle. However, she went to join those South African leaders whose sweat, blood and spirit continue to nourish the freedom of both South Africa and Africans throughout our beloved continent. The ANC, as the ruling party in the Republic of South Africa wishes that you, hon Mavis Ntebaleng Matladi, rest in peace. We send our deepest condolences to the families of Matladi and Setou, as well as to the UCDP. I thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Mrs S V KALYAN</from>
            <p>Speaker, my duty today to pay tribute to a friend and colleague, Ntebaleng Mavis Matladi, is not an easy one. I remember her with fondness and love. What was initially passed off as a bout of flu suddenly developed into a more serious illness and she slipped into a coma, eventually succumbing to respiratory failure on 2 December last year. Her family, community and friends were devastated by her sudden passing, especially as she was relatively young.</p>
            <p>The late hon Matladi entered local government politics for the UCDP in 1995 and steadily progressed through the party structures until she became the first woman president of the UCDP on 29 January 2011.</p>
            <p>We came to be good friends when we were both elected to represent our Parliament at the Pan-African Parliament. We spent many evenings chatting about life in general, our families and our jobs as parliamentarians. I found her to be confident and unafraid to take on challenges. Her decision to stand as president of the UCDP was a tough but necessary one, and she threw herself into this position with passion and enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>The late hon Matladi placed great emphasis on education and was herself highly educated. She instilled the same passion for learning in her three children. Today, Dineo is a biochemist, Karabo is an accountant and Keitumetse is a lawyer, bearing testimony to her values.</p>
            <p>I had the privilege of visiting her family at their home in Zeerust recently. Her husband, Jacob, spoke with pride of his wife and her many achievements. We also all shared a laugh as we fondly remembered how she loved to dress up. Her husband said that when he came to pack up her home in Cape Town, he just sat on the bed and looked at her wardrobe and remembered how beautiful she looked in her many outfits.</p>
            <p>I myself remember during PAP sittings that the MPs from Ghana would arrive with the most exquisite fabrics, and we would get together after the sittings and choose patterns and fabrics for her outfits. Although she has been called to rest early in her life, she has left a legacy of note.</p>
            <p>I would like to dedicate the words of Flavia Weedn, entitled "Some People", to Mavis:</p>
            <p>Some people come into our lives and leave footprints on our hearts and we are never, ever the same. Some people come into our lives and quickly go ... Some stay for a while and embrace our silent dreams. They help us become aware of the delicate winds of hope ... and we discover within every human spirit there are wings yearning to fly ...</p>
            <p>This is how I will remember her. The DA offers strength to the Matladi family and to the UCDP at this time of loss.</p>
            <p>Robal Ka Kagiso Motaung. [May your soul rest in peace, Motaung.]</p>
            <p>May her soul rest in peace. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Somlomo, ngexesha sonke besixakekile yimigidi neziyolo zokuphela konyaka, kuyimitshato kuyinto nje yonke, umama uMavis Ntebaleng uye wathatyathwa kuthi; kwasuka kwee shwaka kwangathi kudala. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)</p>
            <p>[Mrs Z B N BALINDLELA: Mr Speaker, at the time we were all busy with end-of- the-year traditional ceremonies, celebrations, weddings and everything, Mrs Mavis Ntebaleng was taken away from us. She departed as quietly as she lived.]</p>
            <p>In 2009, she took her seat in this august House as a representative of the UCDP. She was party leader. In addition, as my neighbour in our offices, we were friends - very funny friends ...</p>
            <p>... ngoba umama uMaNtebaleng ebengumntu ongangxamiyo xa ehamba, engagxanyi koko eyintokazi ekwakusithiwa ngela xesha ngu ... [... because Mrs Ntebaleng was a person who used to strut carefully when walking, a person who, back in the day, used to be called ...]</p>
            <p>... kyk hoe mooi ... [... look how nice ...]</p>
            <p>... ngoba ebehamba ngokuzithanda engcambaza kwaye kubonakala ukuba yinzwakazi yokwenene. [... because she used to walk in a very confident manner and you could see that she was indeed a lady.]</p>
            <p>I bear personal testimony also from working with her in the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Scopa. She was a remarkably focused woman. She loved her work and, more than that, she understood very clearly that what she was doing in Parliament was for the poor and the marginalised people who had sent her here. She had a mission and this was so powerful that whenever I met her I was overawed by her passion and commitment.</p>
            <p>She loved her people so dearly and she loved Setswana. She tried to teach me Setswana but my tongue was a bit stiff ...</p>
            <p>... ndiqinelwe lulwimi noko andakwazi, kodwa ndandimana ndimhlekisa ngezinto endandimana ndiziva ziculwa ndithi, "Uyayazi laa ngoma ithi tlakantshintshi, tlakantshintshi, rhatina dinela." Ndizama ukuzenza ngathi nam ndiyasazi isiTswana. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)</p>
            <p>[... I couldn't speak well because my tongue was a bit stiff, but I used to make her laugh with the songs that I used to listen to. Do you know the song that says, "Tlakantshintshi, tlakantshintshi, rhatina dinela"? I was trying to act as if I knew Setswana.]</p>
            <p>She was a wonderful teacher, an activist, a politician, a leader, a mother and grandmother. Not only will the political party she led miss her, as we who knew her will, but her husband, her two girls and her son will miss her even more. Her two grandchildren will miss her sorely. She doted on them so much. There will also be a considerable void for her parents and three siblings.</p>
            <p>For me, too, there will be an emptiness whenever I go to a Scopa meeting. Her familiar smile greeting me will never again light up the committee room. Her sense of purpose to get things done, however, will remain with me and I will strive harder than before to remember that we, as a country, must get full value for our rand. We cannot allow leakages that compromise services for the poor and the marginalised people of our country.</p>
            <p>I want Mme maNtebaleng to know that we say ...</p>
            <p>... robala ka kagiso, mme Matladi. Re tla nna re go gopola. [Legofi.] [... rest in peace, Mrs Matladi. We will always remember you. [Applause.]]</p>

            <from>Mr N SINGH</from>
            <p>Mr Speaker, Deputy President and colleagues, as I look at the clock, it is quite predictable that in about 150 seconds or so you will say: "Hon member, your time is up. Please take your seat."</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#the-speaker">
            <from>The SPEAKER</from>
            <p>It is not up yet, so continue. [Laughter.]</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#mr-n-singh">
            <from>Mr N SINGH</from>
            <p>However, Mr Speaker and colleagues, they say of the clock of life that it is wound but once. And no person has the power to tell just where the hands will stop - at a late or early hour. Now is the only time you have. Live, love and toil with will, for tomorrow the clock may be still.</p>
            <p>In the case of our hon colleague, the hon Matladi, that clock stopped too soon, because her untimely passing came as a great shock to her parents, to her husband, to her children, to her grandchildren and to all of us, her colleagues, in this House.</p>
            <p>However, her legacy will not die with her. Her legacy will live through us and in the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Scopa. I have a few recordings of what she used to say in Scopa. As the previous hon member said, she was such a smart dresser that her pleasant disposition sometimes belied the fact that here was a member who would relentlessly ask questions of officials on irregular spending and unauthorised expenditure.</p>
            <p>I remember an official came to us and said that the SA Social Security Agency, "never paid any supplier without supporting documentation". That's what the official said. But Mrs Matladi said that the only fact was that it was a pity that Mr ... I won't give his name ... did not have the notes from the Auditor-General that stated that Sassa had paid line-supporting documentation. Her question was: Why? This was the kind of questioning that the hon Matladi used to follow in our committee.</p>
            <p>As members have said before me, we will miss her in our committee. We will miss her for upholding her dignity, for upholding the fact that she wanted government to operate in a way where there was no wasteful and fruitless expenditure.</p>
            <p>I share a birth date with her, which is 5 September, and Ms Dudley follows a few days later. I understand that she was the only leader of her party who died in office. As I mention this, I think we also have to recall the fact that the hon Rajbansi, the leader of the MF, also died in office.</p>
            <p>To the Matladi and the Rajbansi families and to the MF and UCDP, on behalf of Prince Buthelezi and the IFP, we extend our heartfelt condolences. To our sister, we say, "Lala ngokuthula sisi." [Rest in peace, our sister.] I thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Mr L W GREYLING</from>
            <p>Mr Speaker, unfortunately I cannot be as poetic as some of my other colleagues who spoke today. The sudden passing away of the UCDP MP Mrs Mavis Matladi came as a huge shock to many of her colleagues and fellow Members of Parliament. It was with great sadness that the ID learnt of her passing on 2 December after a short illness.</p>
            <p>I interacted with Mrs Matladi in the Chief Whips' Forum and I found her to be a very warm person who was very committed to the work at hand. She was a hardworking, dedicated and principled Member of Parliament, who strove to make positive contributions to South African politics and her community. At the time of her death, the 53-year-old Mrs Matladi was a Member of Parliament and president of the UCDP. She had been a member of the North West provincial legislature until the 2009 elections before joining the National Assembly. She served as the chair of Scopa in the North West provincial legislature and the Pan-African Parliament's Women's Caucus.</p>
            <p>On behalf of the ID, I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to all our colleagues in the UCDP, as well as to the surviving family and loved ones of the late Mavis Matladi. Her voice will be sorely missed in this House. I thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Once more, we are gathered here to undertake the sad duty of bidding farewell to a fellow Member of Parliament, the late president of the UCDP, the hon Mavis Ntebeleng Matladi, who passed away on 2 December 2011. On behalf of the UDM, I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to her family, friends and colleagues. The late hon Matladi led her party, the UCDP, with dignity until her death. She passionately advanced the cause of women and their struggle for gender equality. We will forever be grateful to her for her contribution to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts in particular.</p>
            <p>Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who share in her family's grief during this time of bereavement.</p>

            <from>Mnr P J GROENEWALD</from>
            <p>Mnr Speaker, ek het vir Mavis in 1999 leer ken en was vir twee jaar saam met haar in die provinsiale wetgewer van Noordwes. Ek het onmiddellik besef dat sy 'n formidabele vrou is wat 'n bepaalde passie vir kinders en hul opleiding het.</p>
            <p>Gesien in die lig van haar agtergrond en haar akademiese kwalifikasies, kan 'n mens verstaan dat kinders na aan haar hart gel het. Hulle het nie net na aan haar hart gel nie, maar sy het ook vir hul belange geveg en dit met passie uitgeleef.</p>
            <p>Die destydse premier, Popo Molefe, het menigmaal nie antwoorde gehad op die vrae van Mavis Matladi nie.</p>
            <p>Dit is soms 'n wonder - en 'n mens verstaan nie altyd hoekom dit so is nie - dat 'n persoon wat met soveel ywer en passie haar doelwitte in die lewe nagestreef het, dan so skielik te sterwe kom.</p>
            <p>Sy het ook nie geskroom om haar Christenskap uit te leef nie. As nietige wesens besef ons ook dat die lewe nie veel werd is nie, maar dat dit wel so is dat die mens wik, maar God beskik.</p>
            <p>Die VF Plus wil sy medelye en simpatie met die familie en die gesin met die afsterwe van Mavis uitspreek. Soos alreeds ges is, glo ons dat sy in hul harte sal bly voortleef en dat haar werk vir die bemagtiging van kinders en vroue sal voortgaan. Dankie. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)</p>
            <p>[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Speaker, I first got to know Mavis in 1999 and served with her for two years in the North West legislature. I realised almost immediately that Mavis was a formidable woman who had a particular passion for children and their training. When she is viewed against her background and her academic qualifications, one can understand that children were close to her heart. Not only were they close to her heart, but she also fought for their interests and passionately lived this to the full.</p>
            <p>The former premier, Popo Molefe, frequently had no answers to the questions asked by Mavis Matladi.</p>
            <p>It is sometimes strange - and one does not always understand why this is the case - that someone who pursued her goals in life with such dedication and passion should pass away so suddenly.</p>
            <p>Neither did she hesitate to give effect to her Christian convictions. As insignificant creatures we realise that life is not worth much, but that it is indeed the case that man proposes but God disposes.</p>
            <p>The FF Plus wishes to express its condolences and sympathy with the relatives and family at the passing of Mavis. As mentioned earlier, we believe that she will continue to live on in their hearts and that her work for the advancement of women and children will continue. Thank you. [Applause.]]</p>

            <p>Mr Speaker, the ACDP expresses shock and tremendous sadness over the death of UCDP president Mavis Matladi at the close of 2011. Our friend and colleague will be sorely missed. As the leader of the ACDP, Rev Kenneth Meshoe, said at the time:</p>
            <p>Mrs Matladi will be missed for her wise counsel and lively contribution in Parliament. We have come to respect Mrs Matladi for her diligent commitment and her exceptional ability to co-operate closely with members of all political parties.</p>
            <p>As we sat together in the National Assembly, Mavis was for me both serious and fun. She had strong principles and worked diligently, but always knew how to enjoy those around her and to lighten matters up with a laugh. I will remember her as an energetic and powerful presence, a stunning woman who dressed beautifully - a tribute to both the dignity of women, and of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The ACDP extends condolences to the Matladi family and to her friends and colleagues in the UCDP. We are grateful that she knew Jesus Christ as her Lord and Saviour. So, we can be confident that she is at home with her Father in heaven.</p>
            <p>Mavis Matladi was only 53 when she died and, as her colleagues pointed out at her funeral in Zeerust, which I attended, this was not even two months after the death of another colleague and friend, the UCDP's former deputy president, Paul Ditshetelo. This was a double tragedy, which was very disturbing, to say the least. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Mr Speaker and hon Deputy President, the PAC joins Mme Ntebaleng Matladi's family and the UCDP in mourning the untimely death of a political giant.</p>
            <p>Mme Matladi was honest and spoke out on what she believed in, even at the risk of becoming unpopular. Her life was navigated by her conscience. When the whole House - in fact, the whole nation - was united behind South Africa hosting the Fifa World Cup, Mme Matladi differed strongly. She was an extraordinary leader who could brave the tempest of popular opinion. When the Cabinet decided against bidding for the Olympic Games, it was perhaps a lesson learnt from Mme Matladi.</p>
            <p>I will forever treasure those golden memories I shared with her and other passengers on the Acacia Park-bound bus. We shared jokes and filled the bus with laughter, like the one happy family we were, we are and will always be.</p>

            <from>Mr R B BHOOLA</from>
            <p>Mr Speaker, when a person passes on, it is undoubtedly a sad moment, especially if one had the amazing characteristics of a true citizen of humanity, like the leader of the UCDP, the late hon M N Matladi. On behalf of the MF, I convey our heartfelt condolences to the Matladi family, friends and relatives.</p>
            <p>Those who enjoyed a close association with the late hon Matladi will know that, apart from being a wonderful personality she was extremely passionate about the education fraternity and matters pertaining to women, children and people with disabilities. We pray that God Almighty will continue to give strength and courage to all who are suffering emotional pain and sorrow for the irreplaceable loss of the late hon Matladi.</p>
            <p>The late hon Matladi was very concerned about good, clean governance and strongly believed that the knowledge industry was pivotal in the advancement and the development of a progressive and sustainable democracy. This is precisely why she embarked on a career in the education profession, serving first as an educator and then holding various critical positions in that fraternity. She strongly believed that knowledge gave you power, power gave you strength and strength motivated.</p>
            <p>Our condolences also go to the UCDP for the loss of a vibrant, committed and dedicated leader. Good leaders are those who add value to society, as indicated in the opening of the KwaZulu-Natal legislature by the honourable King Goodwill Zwelithini, who also paid tribute to the late leader of the MF, Mr Amichand Rajbansi, referring to him as a skilful and impeccable leader who made incredible contributions to South African politics. I therefore feel the pain and sorrow of the UCDP and the predicament it finds itself in. May peace be upon her and, through the grace of God Almighty, may her soul rest in peace. I thank you.

            <p>Mr Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon members and the family of the late Mrs Matladi, we were saddened by the news of the untimely death of our colleague, sister and friend. I use the term "untimely", conscious of and painfully aware of the fact that it is God who knows the time, because for us there can never be a right time for our loved ones to pass on. We had heard that she had not been well, but had hoped that she would recover and come back to continue with the work that she loved: that of serving her party and the nation.</p>
            <p>I had known Mrs Matladi as a strong, hardworking person and a determined leader. The passing away of Mrs Matladi is a loss to the country and the continent and represents a setback in the struggle for the emancipation and empowerment of women. On behalf of Azapo, I convey our sincere condolences to the Matladi family, her friends and her party, the UCDP. May her soul rest in peace. Thank you, Mr Speaker. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>The hon Matladi, as everyone can attest, was a great woman and a dedicated member of this House. She is greatly missed as a member of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, which she served with admirable distinction. Her passing was shocking and disturbing. She was indeed an asset to the work of Parliament. She was passionate, persistent and probing in her oversight work. As we pay our last respects to our late colleague, we can only agree with Robert Sobukwe's immortal words, and I quote: "It is meet that we speak the truth before we die", for we are nothing but tools of history. When we are gone, history shall find new tools. Thank you.</p>

            <from>Mr I S MFUNDISI</from>
            <p>Mr Speaker, hon Deputy President and hon members, we in the UCDP and the Matladi family would like to express our gratitude, though sadly, to all who have joined us at our time of bereavement on the loss of our leader, our mother, our first to die in the harness while in Parliament since the democratic dispensation came into being.</p>
            <p>Mrs Matladi was a tenacious Xanthippe who would leave no stone unturned in her quest for excellence in all she did. In her short life, she saw it all in politics. She felt the pain of being removed from chairing the Standing Committee on Public Accounts at the legislature where she served before, because she would not join the ruling party during the floor-crossing. She had to go to court to claim back her membership of the party after she had been unfairly expelled.</p>
            <p>The fact that she took leadership positions - at work, while a teacher and a lecturer, as a member of the women's prayer group in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Southern Africa at its Western Diocese, in the party and here in Parliament, where it was felt that she could represent the institution at a continental level - is proof that she was a woman of substance.</p>
            <p>We take consolation that, while she could not be promoted while still on this side of the Jordan, she has gained promotion in glory. We thank all those who joined the UCDP in sorrow when they learnt that Mavis had been called to higher service. Among them we count the Presidency - there was a special message from the Office of President Jacob Zuma - the Speaker's Office, for the special message that the Speaker sent, all political parties in Parliament, the service officers, some of whom still ask about her, and all South Africans of goodwill for all the tributes and messages of comfort to us as a party and, more so, to her dearly beloved family.</p>
            <p>We thank Parliament for all the support provided during this sad period, even succeeding in sending a delegation to the funeral. We thank them too for the support they gave the family even after the occasion. We salute this descendant of the royal family of the Batlokwa ba ga Sedumedi [Batlokwa of the Sedumedi clan] and the Barolokogadi ba ga Maotwe [Barolokogadi of the Maotwe clan].</p>
            <p>There is a verse in Hymn 120 of the Sesotho Zion hymn book, which goes as follows:</p>
            <p>Seo o nkadimileng sona, ha o re ke se busetse, le teng ke tla leka hore ho lokile ho lokile. (Translation of Sesotho hymn follows.)</p>
            <p>[What You have lent to me, when You say I should return it I will try to say that it's fine, it's fine.]</p>
            <p>The emphasis is on "ke tla leka", [I will try] because it is difficult to part with anything that we as people hold dear. Let us all, nonetheless, take solace in that, even though we feel it was untimely for her to leave, she will have found eternal peace. After all, we are all sojourners on this earth. I thank you.

            <from>Mr L SUKA (ANC)</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the ANC I want to place on record that the attitude displayed by the DA's Gauteng regional leader, Solly Msimanga, towards community members at the recent Protection of State Information Bill hearings in Mamelodi is indicative of the condescending and insensitive manner with which the DA views the suffering of our people.</p>
            <p>At the hearings, Mr Msimanga accused and insulted some of those present by suggesting that they attended the hearings only because they were promised food and T-shirts. He and those of his ilk in the DA showed contempt for our people by questioning the intelligence of our people. In their insulting opinion, the people present at the hearings did not attend because they cared about their country and were interested in issues that affected them, but attended simply because they could be bought with food and clothing.</p>
            <p>This kind of attitude and disregard for the majority of the people of our country is evident when one examines how the DA approaches critical issues affecting our people. [Interjections.] A case in point is the recent HIV and Aids testing lottery. How crass and insulting to reduce a sensitive and deeply concerning issue to a competition.</p>
            <p>The DA grandstands and appears as though they care for the wellbeing of the people of this country, but when their masks slip, the real DA is exposed, where they show just how little they care for the people and how much they care about protecting their elitist privileges. I thank you, Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, President Zuma's remarks last week to the effect that his government intends to review the powers of the Constitutional Court are not only a serious affront to the principle of the separation of powers, but also undermine public confidence in the executive's commitment to upholding the Constitution.</p>
            <p>The Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, the hon Jeff Radebe, has already set out plans to "review the impact of Constitutional Court decisions over the past 17 years". How is it that the executive can initiate a review of the decisions of another arm of state when it has itself been the subject of some of these decisions?</p>
            <p>We have been told that a research institute will conduct the review, but what measures will be put in place to ensure it is an unbiased process? What does Minister Radebe plan to do with the information collected? Indeed, why is this review needed in the first place?</p>
            <p>The government has a duty to uphold the principle of the separation of powers and to respect the independence of the judiciary. If the source of unhappiness is the occasions on which the judicial rulings have taken the executive to task, then the solution is to amend the executive's conduct and not the powers of the court.

            <from>Mrs J D KILIAN (Cope)</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, in an interview in Rapport published two days ago, on Sunday, the Chief Whip of the Majority Party in the National Assembly, Dr Matole Motshekga, again tried to justify government's focused campaign to undermine the independence of the judiciary. He made some profound statements, such as that certain people wanted to hand over the powers of Parliament and President Zuma to the courts; that South Africa was being transformed into a one-party state with unelected people at the helm; and that President Zuma's recent statement that government wanted to review the powers of the Constitutional Court was not unconstitutional or out of order, but that such statements were simply a reflection of public concern over the powers of the courts.</p>
            <p>He also said that for most people it appeared that government had to ask the permission of the courts before it did anything, although government derived its mandate from the people while the courts comprised a handful of appointed people. He also said elements that use the courts for their narrow interests and to prevent transformation were totally out of order and that political parties ran to court to challenge Bills before Parliament.</p>
            <p>Cope realises that the ANC Chief Whip is spearheading a campaign on behalf of certain elements in the ANC - a campaign to change the Constitution of our country. Our concerns are that his statements are irreconcilable with the principle of the separation of powers, which underlies the Constitution. We want to give a warning that such statements, coming from a person who holds a senior position in the governing party and in the National Assembly, can scare off foreign investment. Cope calls on the Deputy President to reaffirm his government and the President's commitment, as head of state, to upholding and defending the Constitution. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, a career guidance initiative launched by Nedbank to assist high-school pupils is welcomed by the ANC. As a key priority area of the ANC's programme of action, this educational project, worth R5,5 million, will benefit more than 40 000 Grade 9 to Grade 12 learners from underprivileged communities.</p>
            <p>We have seen the recent enrolment crisis at tertiary institutions. One of the contributing factors was the lack of career guidance. Many learners who wish to further their studies often arrive at university enrolment centres without a clear idea and plan of what they would like to study.</p>
            <p>This career guidance programme offered by Nedbank, called "My future, my career", will give learners some insight into their future study plans. The programme is aimed at inspiring learners in order to overcome the skills shortage and at curbing the high unemployment rate. More than 100 career choices are showcased via this programme and presented at Ster-Kinekor cinemas in eight provinces.</p>
            <p>Students will be exposed to many career choices, often some they have not heard of or considered. Such a progressive programme will definitely assist students to identify their passions and interests. It is a commendable effort towards ensuring that we enhance the opportunities of the youth of our country so that they can live better lives. I thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Mr L W GREYLING (ID)</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, the ID is extremely concerned about the critical electricity supply situation in South Africa. According to Eskom, the country could be exposed to load shedding as early as April this year.</p>
            <p>It is totally unacceptable that South Africans have been placed in this crisis due to a combination of poor planning, conflicts of interest and instances of gross incompetence at Eskom. Last year, an entirely avoidable accident at Duvha Power Station saw 600 megawatts removed from the grid at a cost of over R2 billion. We are still waiting for the independent report to be submitted to Parliament on how such an occurrence could happen at a professionally run power utility.</p>
            <p>It is also shocking that the completion of the Medupi Power Station has been delayed even further due to a problem with the boiler contract. This R39-billion contract was awarded to Hitachi Power Africa in which, just coincidently, the ANC's funding arm, Chancellor House, has a 25% shareholding. This massive conflict of interest has now threatened our country's energy security and could have a devastating impact on our economy.</p>
            <p>Will the ANC now do the right thing and disinvest Chancellor House from Hitachi Power Africa and also give this country the assurance that their funding arm will not invest in any company that could benefit from the country's proposed infrastructure build programme? I thank you.</p>

            <p>Future projects identified include the refurbishing of a Durban regional laundry worth R171 million and an outpatient department, as well as casualty wards at Estcourt Hospital worth R141 million. An amount of R1,6 billion will also be spent on the new Dr Pixley ka Seme Regional Hospital in the INK area, which comprises Inanda, Ntuzuma and KwaMashu.</p>
            <p>The job-creation figures for these massive projects could see the employment of about 400 artisans, with 215 posts having been advertised already. The filling of these posts will improve the capacity within the department and maintain infrastructure projects. We are pleased that the department of health in KwaZulu-Natal has so far spent 78% of the total allocation and that it hopes to spend the remainder of the budget by the end of the financial year. Thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Rev K R J MESHOE (ACDP)</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, the report in last week's edition of the City Press newspaper about striking mineworkers was alarming indeed. The headline of the report was: "We will kill them if they go to work." These utterances were made after a man was killed, apparently by striking mineworkers who suspected that he was trying to sneak back to the Impala Mine Shaft No 8 to reapply for his job.</p>
            <p>The striking mineworkers allegedly said more people would die if the 17 000 workers fired last month were not reinstated soon. They reportedly threatened to wait for those nonstriking workers at the bus stop. One intimidator was reported to have said: "Every morning you will find dead bodies because we are going to kill them. If they try to go to work, they will die."</p>
            <p>Such utterances are totally unacceptable and have to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. The South African Constitution does not only give workers the right to strike, but it also gives workers the right not to strike. Our Constitution does not encourage lawlessness, intimidation and violence during strike action.</p>
            <p>The ACDP therefore appeals to government, and particularly to the police, to ensure that those workers who want to go to work are allowed to do so without fear that they might be killed by striking workers. Section 205(3) of our Constitution says:</p>
            <p>The objects of the police service are to prevent, combat and investigate crime, to maintain public order, to protect and secure the inhabitants of the Republic and their property and to uphold and enforce the rule of law.</p>

            <from>Dr W G JAMES (DA)</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, our status as the trade and investment gateway into Africa is under threat, unless we make bold moves to enable business to trade more efficiently and more cost-effectively. The continent's largest retail group, our very own Shoprite, reports expenditure of R160 000 a week to secure import permits to distribute meat and milk to their stores in Zambia alone.</p>
            <p>Shoprite has outlets in 13 SADC countries. To trade in the region, management applies for 100 import permits a week, 300 at peak times. For every truck that crosses the border, up to 1 600 documents are required. The situation is compounded when corruption rears its head. It is high time that the Department of Home Affairs and Customs, which falls under the SA Revenue Service, identify pilot sites on our borders to remove barriers that hamper commerce.</p>
            <p>Trade creates jobs at home and it is of the greatest importance that the impediments are lifted. Africa is showing signs of record economic growth and we must do everything possible to share in this. The National Development Plan, the Department of Trade and Industry and the DA's own 8% growth project - in fact, with cross-party consensus - all emphasised the vital importance of removing barriers to trade in Africa so that we can realise our potential.

            <from>Mrs S T WILLIAMS-DE BRUYN (ANC)</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, this statement relates to a poultry project that is inspiring village women. The issue of unemployment and addressing its rising levels remains one of the ANC government's biggest priorities.</p>
            <p>However, the solution does not rely solely on government, but also on people and communities helping themselves. It is thus extremely heart- warming to see how the Dumisani Women's Project in the rural village of Kameelrivier has started a poultry project in which they nurture chickens and sell them in the village and surrounding areas. Their initiative to provide chickens to the people in the area has meant that long trips to the cities in order to purchase live chickens for family rituals and ceremonies in particular are a thing of the past.</p>
            <p>The women utilise wheelbarrows to transport their chickens for sale in the villages. The members of the project do not draw salaries, but are paid stipends depending on their monthly sales. The women hope to grow their business to be able to supply bigger businesses and retailers. We wish them well. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, the death of David Hlongwane, a learner from the Lethabong Secondary School in Soshanguve, is proof that bullying is on the rise in South Africa's schools and that it poses a real threat to the emotional stability and wellbeing of our children.</p>
            <p>It is also clear that not enough is being done to combat this form of emotional and physical abuse in our schools. The IFP urges all principals and parents to embark on programmes that will empower their children on this topic, so that they can develop the necessary coping mechanisms and strategies to deal with bullying and other forms of behaviour that infringe on their rights and wellbeing.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the IFP urges school disciplinary committees to act decisively against bullies. Punitive steps must include suspension, counselling and rehabilitation.</p>

            <from>Mr G B D MC INTOSH (Cope)</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, Eskom's ever-increasing electricity tariffs are having an adverse effect on South Africans, especially the poor. Even though the National Energy Regulator of SA managed to grant a lower electricity tariff increase of only 25,9%, if that is lower, for 2012 than what Eskom at first applied for, the impact of additional tariff increases from other electricity providers such as municipalities are having far-reaching implications for the poor. The repeated increases in electricity costs have averaged over 25% per year since July 2008 and are rapidly making affordable housing in the Johannesburg inner city and elsewhere completely unaffordable.</p>
            <p>Over each of the past four years, the additional increase, on top of the annual Eskom price increases, last year reached the ridiculous increase of 35% for residential properties. This meant that many tenants saw their monthly electricity bills increase by between R150 and R200 per month. Families are crippled by this and struggle to come out on their monthly earnings. While pay packets may have increased, electricity costs over the same period have tripled, far outweighing the earnings of many families. As a result of arrears and write-offs, vacancies have risen to uneconomic levels in the City of Johannesburg, or people move into overcrowded buildings. [Time expired.]</p>

            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, the FF Plus leader, Dr Mulder, in his response to the state of the nation debate, had the temerity to suggest that Africans cannot lay claim to 40% of South African land because they migrated from Northern Africa. He contends that Africans cannot lay claim to the land in the Western Cape and the Northern Cape because they are not the original inhabitants of this land.</p>
            <p>His sweeping generalisations, based on his land maps of the 19th century, ignore the persistent legacy of colonial dispossession and the history of conquest and collusion. To suggest that when white colonialists arrived here the land was empty is a distortion of our painful history and heaps scorn on the current inequalities we experience as a result of colonial invasion.</p>
            <p>Even if we were to ignore his faults and misleading statements, is he suggesting that the majority of people who suffered at the hands of the Voortrekkers, the imperial colonialists and the racist white apartheid regime be relegated to the end of the line and the maximum white ownership and privilege continue unabated?</p>
            <p>He bases his venomous views on what can only be termed as his myopic understanding of our history, tainted by selfishness and shaded by racism. The ANC believes that Dr Mulder would do well to make an effort to learn the truth and desist from distorting history. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, in last week's reply to the state of the nation debate, President Zuma said that most of the corruption you read about in the media is exposed as a result of the work of government and its agencies. These are the words of a President who is completely disconnected from reality. South Africa's major corruption scandals have not been broken by government, but by the media and the opposition. These include the arms deal, Travelgate, Oilgate, the SA Police Service lease debacle and the Chancellor House scandal.</p>
            <p>Nowhere is the government's attitude towards exposing corruption more clear than in its determination to see the Protection of Information Bill, better known as "the Secrecy Bill", pushed through Parliament in its current form.

            <from>Mrs L S MAKHUBELA-MASHELE (ANC)</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, the ANC holds the view that a nation that takes care of its youth ensures a better future, not only for the youth, but for the country as a whole. We thus welcome the launch of the integrated strategy by the Department of Trade and Industry, SA Breweries and the National Youth Development Agency to solve the problem of underage drinking. The campaign, which is called "You Decide", was launched in Durban and targets drinking by children under the age of 18, although it can also be extended to include those who are 21 years of age.</p>
            <p>Statistics show that 25% of teenagers drink because they are bored, while about 45% drink because they are depressed. Whatever the cause, it is a ticking time bomb and extremely dangerous.</p>
            <p>There is a high number of teenagers seeking help at crisis centres, clinics and police stations for, amongst other things, sexual violence, physical abuse, STDs and pregnancies, most of which occurred while they were drinking. An integrated solution, which must involve parents, schools and the youth, is therefore encouraged. I thank you.</p>

          <speech by="#the-minister-of-trade-and-industry">
            <from>The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, first of all, in response to the hon James, who is new in the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry - I presume he must know, but if he doesn't, let me just clarify this for him. If import permits are imposed on South African goods going to other countries, they are imposed by those countries and not by us. This is something that we know as trade facilitation.</p>
            <p>I would also point out that whenever we do enter into discussions with neighbouring countries, for example when we hosted the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa-East Africa Community- Southern African Development Community, Comesa-EAC-SADC, summit last year, our interventions are always to say that building trade relations with African countries are not just about tariff matters. They are also about a whole range of other things, including infrastructure development and trade facilitation. So, we take these matters up when we can.</p>
            <p>I should also say that we have never said, as South Africa, that we seek to set ourselves up as gatekeepers of trade and investment relations with the rest of the continent. But if other countries - third parties - see us as a convenient gateway to building their own relations with the African continent, we are here to work with them and to partner with them.</p>
            <p>And I can just say that I do not believe that we are seeing a reduction in interest. On the contrary, I think what is happening now is that as the world economy enters into a period where Europe is going into recession, there is a growing interest in Africa. In fact, many companies - an increasing number of companies - are coming to South Africa to say: What are the possibilities of working with you in order to build relations with the rest of the African continent?</p>
            <p>Let me also say that I welcome the remarks that were made about underage drinking. I think that is a very important campaign. I should just say that the question of alcohol abuse in this country is no small matter. Half the number of unnatural deaths, road accidents and violent crime that we have in this country is the result of abuse of either alcohol or drugs. The liquor regulators will be meeting in the very near future with their counterparts in the provinces to devise a much more holistic strategy to deal with the curse of alcohol abuse. Thank you very much. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to say that I have just come from Cuba and was feeling very fresh. [Interjections.] But the amount of ideological pollution coming from the benches on the other side of this House is really very disturbing. [Interjections.]</p>
            <p>Allow me to respond to two statements by two members. First of all, I fully agree with the hon Mkhulusi regarding the role that the private sector or some in the private sector are playing in career guidance. Indeed, as the department we fully welcome these initiatives.</p>
            <p>In many ways they are building on the initiatives taken by our department through, among other things, the SA Qualifications Authority-run Khetha project. This is a career guidance project with a helpline, a website and weekly broadcasts on SABC's nine radio stations in different languages in our country. Nevertheless, we would like to say that much as we welcome these initiatives, as government we would like to see improved synergies between what government is doing and other initiatives taken by the private sector or nongovernmental organisations.</p>
            <p>In response to the hon member who talked about corruption, I think it is important to say that we do not actually allow narrow opposition propaganda to distort the truth in this House. [Interjections.] We must distinguish between activities of corruption that are reported by the media and actions that are taken by government to expose corruption that do not appear in the media. [Interjections.]</p>
            <p>I would like to challenge the hon member not to just come with a few things, but to come here with a complete record of activities of corruption that have been exposed by this government, including the many investigations ... [Interjections.] ... instigated by government through the Special Investigating Unit. [Interjections.]</p>
            <p>Often what the media says in this country is not a reflection of truth. And, often, it is in line with what the opposition is saying. That is why they come and quote newspapers here as if that is the truth. Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>The MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, I think it is absolutely important that when we wish to present statements to the House, we don't in any way impute bad faith to any individual who sits in this House or any statement made by a member of the executive or of this House.</p>
            <p>The President stated very clearly in his reply last week that the intention of government is to review decisions that are germane to the executive and its exercise of power in terms of national and other legislation that have been the subjects of rulings by the Constitutional Court. I did not hear him refer to reviewing the powers of the Constitutional Court in his reply. He referred to decisions and an assessment of government in terms of how those decisions have impacted on policy and what lessons we, as the executive, must derive from that review.</p>
            <p>This is, absolutely correctly, to be done in order to improve our own functioning as the executive, as well as to understand how to ensure that the policies we are responsible for are absolutely in line with what is mandated in the Constitution. So, I don't know what all this fuss is about. I really think that members are looking for evil where none exists. We are acting well within what the executive should do and I believe that it is a responsible step that is being taken by government.</p>
            <p>I do not have any mandate to reply for the Chief Whips. Perhaps when the Chief Whips meet, they could talk to each other about how they read interviews and assess the meaning of particular interviews. Our Constitution is the document of this institution. We are responsible for ensuring that we act with regard to it. We swear oaths to ensure that it is implemented and that we uphold it. And I would think that the Chief Whip, having been so sworn, would recognise that it is indeed his obligation to act in the way he did when he stood before all of us in this House.</p>
            <p>Finally, may I say that we have taken action, hon Zikalala, in respect of acid mine drainage. We've had an intergovernmental committee and funds have been set aside. We have also appointed, through the Department of Water and Environmental Affairs, persons and companies that will assist us with the spillages and other impacts of acid mine drainage.</p>
            <p>I will ask my hon colleague, Mrs Molewa, to approach the appropriate committee and ensure that her report is tabled, but action has been taken. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to agree with the hon Malale that the 40% story by the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is a dangerous one and the President has said so.</p>
            <p>It is precisely the reasoning behind what made the Western Cape a coloured preferential area. It is precisely the same reasoning that suggested we must be confined to the areas they called Bantustans; that is where they said we originated.

            <from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF BASIC EDUCATION</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, in response to the hon member from the IFP who raised his concern about bullying, all forms of violence, intimidation and harassment are prohibited. Bullying can take the form of either physical violence inflicted on the victim or emotional violence.</p>
            <p>We certainly promote the adoption of a code of conduct in every school. To this end, given the reality that next month approximately 27 000 schools will have their elections, I think it would be timely and appropriate for us to convey a message to each one of these gatherings that bullying in any form, be it emotional or physical, will not be tolerated in our schools. We too would like to convey our condolences to the family of the victim and certainly share the sentiments of the hon member.</p>
            <p>With regard to the statement relating to career guidance, we take note of what the hon Minister of Higher Education and Training has said. We wish to emphasise that there are instances in which career guidance is provided, such as those by the Department of Science and Technology. The department provides career guidance for young engineers and promotes mathematics and science. Also, career guidance forms part of life orientation, which is a compulsory subject.</p>
            <p>I think what is critical for us to understand and recognise is that subject choices are made when the learner passes Grade 9. Career guidance, in fact, should take place prior to the learner going to the FET band, which are Grades 10, 11 and 12. This is because those subject choices will, in fact, determine the ultimate destiny of that particular learner. To that end, we are emphasising the importance of assisting learners in terms of subject choices at an earlier rather than at a later stage. I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>

            <from>Ms N R BHENGU</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon members, I rise to present the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Filling of Vacancies in the Commission for Gender Equality, CGE.</p>
            <p>On 17 November 2011, the House took a resolution to establish an ad hoc committee to identify suitable candidates for the filling of vacancies in the Commission for Gender Equality. The committee consisted of 12 members made up as follows: 7 ANC members; 2 DA members; 1 Cope member; l IFP member and 1 member from the other parties. The committee was granted powers as contained in Rule 138 of the National Assembly Rules and was ordered to finalise its task and report to the House by no later than 21 February 2012.</p>
            <p>The committee held its first meeting on 14 December 2011 and unanimously appointed me as its chairperson. The meeting was attended by all political parties except Cope, that had tendered an apology. The committee agreed to consider all 175 nominees submitted by the Minister of Women, Children and People with Disabilities and to short-list 13 candidates for interviews. However, owing to co-operation between the ANC and the opposition parties, the committee finally short-listed 15 candidates. In preparation for the short-listing meeting scheduled for 11 January 2012, it was agreed that the ANC should short-list 13 candidates and that all opposition parties should jointly short-list 13 candidates.</p>
            <p>The meeting also agreed that the criteria for short-listing should consider the following important points: content sharpness; administrative skills; continuity; fresh ideas; vision and passion; academic qualifications; community orientation or activism; the financial skills necessary to oversee the secretariat; and knowledge of constitutional values.</p>
            <p>A set of standard questions was developed and agreed to by the committee. Each member of the committee was allocated a set number of questions to ask during the interviews, which were scheduled for 25 and 26 January 2012.</p>
            <p>On 11 January 2012 the committee reconvened and all parties were present except the ACDP, which had tendered its apology. However, only the ANC was ready with its short list of candidates. The meeting had to adjourn in order to allow the opposition parties time to consolidate their short list of candidates.</p>
            <p>When the meeting later reconvened, and after much deliberation, it was agreed that l5 candidates be short-listed and interviewed. However, one candidate later withdrew and the committee interviewed 14 candidates.</p>
            <p>Following the finalisation of the short-listing process and the release of the names of candidates, the committee received a letter from the current acting chairperson of the CGE, Dr Teboho Maitse, in which she questioned the omission of certain nominees from the short list and the inclusion of some.</p>
            <p>In response to her allegations, the committee reiterated its commitment to the transparency, the credibility and the legitimacy of the process to nominate members of the commission in accordance with the Constitution and the Commission for Gender Equality Act. The committee also emphasised that it could not exclude any person nominated solely on the basis of allegations that had not yet been adjudicated upon by a competent tribunal.</p>
            <p>The committee further received a set of proposed questions from some NGOs who had nominated certain candidates for appointment. The committee refused to consider these questions on the basis that candidates proposed by those NGOs would be unfairly advantaged compared to others.</p>
            <p>The committee concluded interviews on 25 January and 26 January 2012. However, during the interviews, only the ANC and the DA participated as all other parties had apologised. After due consideration and after applying its mind, the committee recommended nine candidates as fit and proper persons to effectively and efficiently carry out the mandate of the commission.</p>
            <p>The committee is therefore recommending that the House recommends to the President the appointment of the following persons as members of the CGE: Mr Mfanozelwe Shozi, Ms Lulama Nare, Ms Sylvia Desiree Stevens-Maziya, Ms Janine Hicks, Ms Ndileka Eumera Portia Loyilane, Mr Wallace Amos Mgoqi, Ms Nondumiso Maphazi Ranuga, Ms Thoko Mpumlwana, and Prof Amanda Gouws.</p>
            <p>Allow me to present a brief profile of each candidate. Mr Mfanozelwe Shozi has a Masters Degree in Community Development and has worked for the CGE for almost nine years. His community involvement includes playing various roles in Adult Basic Education and Training, Abet, and in the co-ordination of development programmes in KwaZulu-Natal. In l998 he was elected as adult educator of the year in KwaZulu-Natal. Through his tireless work he was instrumental in ensuring that the community of Mary Grey got a mobile clinic from the Department of Health.</p>
            <p>Ms Lulama Nare has a BA degree and vast experience in management, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity-building. She is involved with the National Economic Development and Labour Council, Nedlac, and the SA Democratic Teachers Union's Gender Unit and is a member of the Presidential Working Group on the global economic crisis. Her community involvement includes working with civil rights organisations to ensure access to essential services by needy communities.</p>
            <p>Ms Sylvia Desiree Stevens-Maziya is a social worker by profession with a postgraduate diploma in Development Management and Administration. Currently, she is a community development worker in the National Department of Co-operative Governance. She is a former member of the United Democratic Front, a current member of the SA National Civic Organisation, Sanco, the ANC Women's League, the SACP and the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union. She is currently an adviser of the body called "Children in Difficult Circumstances" and has been since 2009.</p>
            <p>Ms Janine Hicks has an LLB degree and is a PhD candidate at the University of the Western Cape. She has been a commissioner at the CGE since 2007 and therefore provides continuity. She has published many journals and articles on women's issues. While serving as a commissioner at CGE, she initiated many projects in partnership with Cosatu and other government departments, such as the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, the Department of Higher Education and Training, and the Presidency, all geared towards gender transformation in the public sector.</p>
            <p>Ms Ndileka Eumera Portia Loyilane is a nominee of the Disabled People of South Africa. She has served on the commission for the past five years. She possesses a B.Com degree and is doing a B.Com honours degree. Regarded as the voice of the disabled, she has held several leadership positions, which include being the Chair of the Disabled Women's Development Programme. Currently, she is serving as the Deputy Chairperson of the SA Disability Development Trust. In 2001 she was appointed by the Eastern Cape MEC for Housing to chair the Housing Advisory Panel of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Traditional Affairs.</p>
            <p>Mr Wallace Amos Mgoqi is a human rights lawyer and a recipient of the Duma Nokwe Award for Human Rights. He possesses three doctoral degrees from different universities. He has presented various papers on human rights, both nationally and internationally. He has been instrumental in the establishment of the Community Development Trust for the Sokhulu, Mbonombi and Dube communities. Recently he was appointed to conduct an inquiry into the concerns and grievances of students and staff at the Walter Sisulu University.</p>
            <p>Ms Nondumiso Maphazi Ranuga is currently studying towards a doctorate in Public Administration with a special focus on good governance. She is currently a special adviser to the premier of the Eastern Cape and was previously the executive mayor of the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality and a Member of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Ms Thoko Mpumlwana is a teacher by profession, with a Masters degree, and has a community service record of more than 30 years. Until recently she served the country as deputy chairperson of the Electoral Commission of South Africa. In the international arena she has served as the chair of the World Council of Churches Women's Committee. Whilst working for the Centre for Scientific Development at the Human Sciences Research Council, she focused on gender equality matters. Currently, she is the chair of the Film and Publication Board.</p>
            <p>Prof Amanda Gouws possesses a PhD in Political Science and has received many awards. She is the founder member of the Human Rights Mainstreaming Unit at the University of Stellenbosch and of many other women's movements. Prof Gouws has written many articles and books on gender-related matters. She has delivered papers around women's issues, both nationally and internationally.</p>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the ANC's study group and the hon Robinson of the DA for their commitment to the mandate given to them by Parliament. They served the committee with dedication and displayed respect for each other's views. I would also like to thank all members who served on the ad hoc committee. They demonstrated a keen interest in selecting the most capable candidates to serve on the CGE. It was a pleasure to chair a committee that could look at issues with such a broad perspective. I thank you. [Applause.]</p>

          <speech by="#mrs-d-robinson">
            <from>Mrs D ROBINSON</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Commission for Gender Equality, one of our Chapter 9 institutions, was established to bolster our fledgling democracy and uphold the values enshrined in the Constitution. Its main function is to advance the development, protection and attainment of gender equality and promote respect for the institution.</p>
            <p>Amongst other things, it has the power to monitor, investigate, subpoena, research, educate and advocate throughout the country, in urban and deep rural areas. This is a major challenge owing to the great distances to be covered, the fact that the commissioners are not situated in all the provinces and that not all language groups are represented.</p>
            <p>In a country like ours, which still suffers a massive burden in respect of patriarchal attitudes, bias and prejudice, it is important that gender transformation takes place to enable every citizen to enjoy equal rights, whether young, old, widowed, married or single. It is vital that the commission is efficient and effective and that it is respected by all citizens so that the abuse of human rights, particularly gender and domestic violence, can be eradicated.</p>
            <p>It is unfortunate that the CGE has been in the news over the past few years owing to its underperformance and mismanagement, both administrative and financial. However, after the forensic investigation was completed and its turnaround strategy was adopted, it has shown an improvement in its management and performance. Yet many NGOs, which play a vital role in assisting victims of abuse and injustice, believe that the CGE has still not fulfilled its mandate of monitoring legislation and checking on its accountability adequately.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it is crucial that the new commissioners are people with extensive knowledge of gender issues and experience as gender activists - people who can advocate issues with conviction and credibility. It is important that the commissioners understand the intersections of gender, HIV/Aids, poverty and disability and that they understand and advance lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex, or LGBTI, rights.</p>
            <p>The commissioners need to be people who have the courage of their convictions to challenge religious and cultural practices that undermine gender equality. It is vital that they are people of integrity who have the ability to hold government and other institutions of power and influence to account, including civil society.</p>
            <p>Sadly, some of the candidates who qualified in every respect and had extensive experience of gender matters did not reach the final list. The DA cannot support the nomination of the controversial Mr Wallace Mgoqi, who first served as a land commissioner before assuming office as a municipal manager. Subsequent to his departure from that office, he was a candidate for the Human Rights Commission. He then made himself available as a gender commissioner, despite the fact that he has no real track record in the field of gender activism or advocacy. One cannot but wonder whether he was simply trying to acquire more caps or whether he is truly dedicated to the task at hand - that of bringing about gender equality. It seems he has friends in high places.</p>
            <p>It is to be recommended that once the overhaul of the Chapter 9 institutions has taken place, as advocated by the late Prof Kader Asmal, the statutory requirements regarding the composition of the selection panel will be changed so that there will be less political influence in the choice of commissioners. Those who serve on the selection panel for the CGE should not only be politicians, but experts in gender studies and practice.</p>
            <p>It is unfortunate that the DA was the only opposition party that participated fully in the selection process. Perhaps if there had been representation from other opposition parties, we could have presented a united front to ensure that fitness for purpose was the main criterion for selection.</p>
            <p>In order to have a well-functioning democratic institution such as the CGE, which is there to protect our constitutional rights, it is important that there should be full participation by all parties. This is so that we are not put in a position in which the ruling party completely dominates the selection process. Ndiyabulela, Somlomo. [Thank you, Speaker.] [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Mrs M A A NJOBE</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon members, even though Cope, owing to unforeseen circumstances, missed some of the interviews, it agrees with the methodology that was followed to reach the recommended list of candidates. So, we are not questioning the procedure.</p>
            <p>However, with regard to the Commission for Gender Equality itself, we would like to point out the following: It is a good thing for the Department of Women, Children and People with Disabilities to interact with the Commission for Gender Equality. The questions that the department needs to answer are: How often does this interaction occur? To what extent does the CGE participate in national gender programmes and initiatives? With regard to the recent spate of violent attacks on women because of what they chose to wear, what is the CGE's response? This we ask because we saw the Minister and her entourage carrying out this campaign.</p>
            <p>What are the interventions of the CGE in the escalation of hatred for gays and lesbians? What about employment opportunities for women? What has the CGE got to say? Women want the CGE to be clearly visible in all factors that affect their lives.</p>
            <p>Cope agrees, however, that strides have been made to address inequalities as far as education is concerned. Yet, even though there are more women enrolled in higher education than men, few women graduate in science, engineering and technology. The skills gap between women and men and between rural and urban women are still huge. The masculine culture is perpetrating inequalities. How many teachers in the foundation phase are men? The majority of women are unemployed. Inequalities in the remuneration between sexes are conspicuous. Women in the same category as men are still paid less than men for equal input and output.</p>
            <p>These are some of the challenges the new commissioners will be confronted with. We hope that they will be able to address them and that the CGE is going to be more visible than we have observed lately. However, we support the appointment of the new commissioners. I thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, the IFP supports the recommendations of the committee tasked with the appointment of new commissioners to the Commission for Gender Equality. As one of our Chapter 9 institutions, it has a most solemn and sacred responsibility to the people of South Africa for the diligent and due performance of its constitutionally mandated tasks.</p>
            <p>Its successes or failures in this regard fall largely under the care and direction of its commissioners as it is these commissioners that will ultimately be held responsible and accountable. The commission requires competent and skilled members who are capable of both encapsulating and implementing its vision and mandate without fear, favour or prejudice.</p>
            <p>To the new commissioners, the country has placed its faith and trust in you. You are now the guardians of an institution mandated to play a significant role in the strengthening of our constitutional democracy. Do not take this task lightly. The IFP wishes the new commissioners all the very best with their appointments. I thank you. [Applause.]</p>

          <speech by="#mrs-c-dudley">
            <from>Mrs C DUDLEY</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, the ACDP congratulates the candidates who were recommended for appointment to the Commission on Gender Equality and wishes all of them every success. When I communicated with people whose work centred on issues of gender equality, I got the following responses: "My impression of the CGE," they said, "is that it is very much a lame duck. If the commission is doing good work, it manages to keep it pretty secret." "Yes, it probably confronts funding constraints, but so do we all. That is not an excuse; it is a challenge that needs to be risen above by dynamic, innovative leadership and team building."</p>
            <p>There was acknowledgement that some recommended candidates were very highly regarded in academic circles, while others were met with reservations about appointing commissioners who had no track record in gender activism. Those who have no gender background but offered expertise in organisation or team building and strategic thinking, they conceded, needed to be guided by those who better understood the issues. Stakeholders will be watching the process unfold with interest.</p>
            <p>People are particularly interested in the vision of these recommended candidates and how they understand the CGE's mandate; how they envisage raising its public profile; which key issues they will work on; which campaigns could be developed; and which constituencies they will work with - all questions covered during interviews by Members of Parliament with the candidates.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the commission should consider publishing this information in an effort to lift the CGE profile and engage with the public. Up until now, public engagement has been so low-profile as to be effectively nonexistent. Gender inequalities are not simply about women's equality with men. According to United Nations estimates, if gender inequalities in the labour market, for example, were eliminated, women's wages would rise by 50% and gross domestic product by 5%. Everyone would benefit, not just women.</p>
            <p>The extent to which a new commission sees gender equity as a zero-sum game is critical. If it is perceived as benefits for women and losses for men, instead of a win-win situation in which both men and women stand to benefit, success will be limited. The ACDP is in support of this. Thank you.</p>

            <from>Mrs I C DITSHETELO</from>
            <p>We in the UCDP accept the names of those recommended. We take into account that the retention of some members is meant for continuity and avoiding throwing the baby out with the bath water, because there is institutional memory to uphold, rather than starting over from scratch. We hope government officials will assist the commission to live up to addressing the concern the President raised in the state of the nation address - that women need to be supported. The UCDP supports the nominated members for the commission. Thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon members, Azapo has nothing against any of the persons on the list. We have reason to believe that the hon members who sat to select from the original list applied their minds properly.</p>
            <p>We saw the list from which the final list was drawn and we can only express disappointment that a gender activist of note did not make it onto the final list. We are referring here to Mr Mbuyiseli Botha, a tireless fighter for gender equality in our country. It was through him and the Sonke Gender Justice Network that a certain wayward youth leader was fined R50 000 by the Equality Court. The Commission on Gender Equality will be poorer without him.</p>
            <p>Having said that, Azapo supports the recommendation of the ad hoc committee. We thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon members, it is sad but not unexpected that the DA comes to the podium to cast aspersions on the character of a commissioner based on their political assumptions. It must be noted that the ad hoc committee was unanimous in agreeing on the names to be put forward to the House, and the DA was part of that ad hoc committee at the time.</p>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#mr-g-t-snell">
            <from>Mr G T SNELL</from>
            <p>Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. It has been stated that the Commission for Gender Equality is one of the most crucial institutional elements of our constitutional democracy. Its important role in our society is evidenced by the status accorded it by our Constitution. Chapter 9, section 187 of the Constitution of the Republic defines its mandate in that the commission "must promote respect for gender equality and the protection, development and attainment of gender equality". The CGE is empowered by the Constitution to monitor, investigate, research, educate, lobby, advise and report on issues concerning gender equality.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Commission on Gender Equality Act, Act 39 of 1996, gives further power to the CGE to transform society through state intervention. Amongst these legislative powers are the monitoring and evaluation of policies and practices of organs of state, strategic bodies and public bodies, as well as the private sector; evaluating any piece of legislation to ensure its consistency with the Constitution and a culture of human rights; and recommending new legislation to promote gender equality and the status of women.</p>
            <p>Both the constitutional stipulations, as well as those contained in the Act, constitute an acknowledgement of the reality of the continued persistence of social inequalities within our young democratic dispensation. It bears testimony to the fact that though democracy has been obtained, our goal for a nonsexist society in which there is gender equality is still some way off. The CGE is therefore a critical mechanism for social transformation. A well-managed and optimally functioning CGE is an integral component of transformation towards the achievement of gender equality. Given the enormous importance, tasks and obligations that the CGE is expected to perform in terms of the Constitution and the CGE Act, it is imperative that Parliament give priority to ensuring that its capacity is strengthened. The debate on the appointment of its commissioners is therefore welcome and opportune for today. The ANC, which as a party is based on the principles of equality, nonsexism, nonracism and democratic values, stands for the eradication of patriarchy in our society, the liberation of women, the eradication of the triple oppression of black women, the working class and especially African women. By establishing a developmental state, the ANC seeks active state intervention in promoting gender equality throughout society. Through state intervention, it seeks to enforce current laws and policies that address inequalities, educate society on gender issues and inculcate progressive values into society to address gender challenges.</p>
            <p>Given these fundamental principles and values, the ANC has supported the establishment of the CGE and will relentlessly continue to support the work of the commission. Our commitment to social transformation makes us determined to ensure that the CGE is strengthened. We believe that as long as we have an unequal society, we will need a strong, progressive and transformational CGE. We believe that any institution is as good as its people. Therefore the recommendation of the commissioners today by Parliament is crucial for the building of capacity within the CGE to perform its constitutional tasks.</p>
            <p>The quality of the proposed commissioners will significantly assist in addressing the historical challenges that the organisation has faced in the past. We believe that from now on the CGE will go from strength to strength. The ANC supports the appointment of the proposed commissioners. I thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Mr M I MALALE</from>
            <p>Madam Deputy Speaker and Mr Deputy President, the portfolio committee has considered the amendments that were effected by the National Council of Provinces regarding the colleges Bill, which was referred to the NCOP on 12 September 2011.</p>
            <p>We unanimously adopted those recommendations. Those recommendations relate to the introduction of the definition of a family member in the Bill that was referred. The suggested definition is that family member refers to parents of a member of the college council or a member of any office committee. It refers to siblings, children, including stepchildren and adopted children, a spouse, and a life partner in cohabitation. We felt that this amendment reinforced our work as a committee.</p>
            <p>The further additional changes that we introduced were of a grammatical nature, that is substituting "are" for "is", which we thought we should agree to.</p>
            <p>You will recall that in the debate we had on 12 September the DA did not support the Bill on the basis that they preferred to retain colleges under the auspices of provincial administrations. We felt that that was unfortunate, because we were very clear on where we needed to go as a country. Also, that could have been motivated by the fact that they wanted to retain and perhaps influence the role of colleges that are clustered here in the Western Cape in their quest for "The People's Republic of the Western Cape".</p>
            <p>We hope they will agree with us now, because during the debate in the committee Dr Bosman, who is our new member, replacing the hon Van der Westhuizen, and Dr Kloppers-Lourens agreed with us on these amendments. We hope ... [Inaudible.] ... just riding on the wave of the previous process, you'll support us. [Interjections.] We ... [Inaudible.] ... which could be attested to by those former members who were affected by your redeployment strategy.</p>
            <p>We agreed in the committee that the Minister would deal with the issues relating to the parity of benefits for college-employed employees and state employees in the context of the changes that were advanced by that Bill.</p>
            <p>There is a need for the upgrading of the skills base of lecturers in the FET sector. There is a need to enhance the programmes or vocational choices that are available in the sector to attract students. All of us in the committee never had any problems on these matters. We may have to hear about whatever issues of grandstanding there were that may emerge from the process, as attested to by the mumblings on the other side.</p>
            <p>We therefore, as a committee, recommend that the House adopt this Bill with the amendments, as suggested by the NCOP. Thank you very much. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>There was no debate.</p>

            <from>Mnr A P VAN DER WESTHUIZEN</from>
            <p>Agb Voorsitter, agb lede, die DA glo dat iets drasties aan die uitermate swak prestasie van ons openbare Kolleges vir Verdere Onderwys en Opleiding gedoen moet word. Die kolleges presteer so swak onder Minister Nzimande se beheer dat die departement nou nog nie die resultate van verlede jaar se eindeksamens wil openbaar nie.</p>
            <p>Ongelukkig is Minister Nzimande met hierdie wetsontwerp besig om die fout op die verkeerde plek te soek. Dit is nie net die DA wat so glo nie; Minister Pandor, in haar vorige posisie as Minister van Onderwys, het soos die DA geglo dat groter plaaslike aanspreeklikheid vir kolleges die oplossing sal wees.</p>
            <p>Minister Pandor het 'n ideaal of droom gehad wat nou deur hierdie wetsontwerp vernietig sal word. Sy het geglo dat die diensure van kolleges en hul personeel by plaaslike behoeftes moet aanpas op 'n wyse wat buite die beperkinge van die Staatsdiens val. Sy het dus vyf jaar gelede hierdie Huis oortuig om 'n wet te aanvaar wat die personeel van die kolleges uit die staat se diens sou stel en om die kollegerade hulle werkgewers te maak. Sy het ook die ideaal gehad dat personeel met skaars vaardighede vanuit die industrie na die kolleges gelok sou kon word. Ongelukkig het die departement die kollegerade met die implementering van hierdie wet gefaal.</p>
            <p>Minister Nzimande, wat blykbaar glo dat alles en almal vanuit Pretoria beheer moet word, is besig om daardie ideaal te vernietig. In plaas daarvan dat plaaslike gemeenskappe in beheer van hul kolleges geplaas word, word dit nou na die nasionale departement in Pretoria oorgedra. In plaas van groter buigsaamheid en outonomie, gaan ons kolleges in die nou drukgang van staatsinstellings gedwing word.</p>
            <p>Elkeen van ons 50 openbare kolleges is uniek in hul personeelbehoeftes en elkeen verg 'n eie personeelstruktuur of organogram. Die Staatsdiens se salarisskale en die vaste organisasiestruktuur wat uit hierdie wetsontwerp sal voortvloei, bied eenvoudig nie die buigbaarheid wat nodig is om goeie kollegelektore in skaars vakke te lok en te behou nie.</p>
            <p>Openbare kolleges wat voorheen 'n provinsiale verantwoordelikheid was, gaan nou die verantwoordelikheid van een nasionale staatsdepartement word. Wie op die kollegerade gaan dien, hoe hul kurrikula, hul taalbeleid, aanstellingsbeleid en 'n legio ander belangrike sake daarna gaan uitsien, gaan uiteindelik vanuit Pretoria bepaal word. In die proses word die magte van die kollegerade afgewater, tot nadeel van die studente. Hierdie nasionalisering van openbare kolleges sal tot gevolg h dat die departement verskeie provinsiale kantore sal moet vestig. Geld wat na die klaskamers moes vloei, sal nou in provinsiale kantore verkwis word. In die proses word die koste van opleiding andermaal geweldig opgestoot.</p>
            <p>Ons land kan dit nie bekostig nie. Om hierdie redes kan die DA hierdie wetsontwerp nie steun nie. Dankie. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans declaration of vote follows.)</p>
            <p>[Mr A P VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: Hon Chairperson, hon members, the DA believes that drastic action should be taken with regard tt colleges. These colleges are performing so poorly under the management of Minister Nzimande that the department at this stage still does not want to disclose the results of last year's end-of-year exams.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, with this Bill Minister Nzimande is busy looking for the flaw in the wrong place. It is not only the DA that holds this conviction; Minister Pandor, in her former capacity as the Minister of Education, believed, like the DA, that the solution would be greater accountability for colleges at local level.</p>
            <p>Minister Pandor had had an ideal or a dream, which will now be destroyed by this Bill. She believed that the working hours of colleges and their staff should be adapted to local needs in a manner that would fall outside the limitations of the Public Service. She therefore had convinced this House five years ago to adopt an Act that would take the staff of these colleges out of the Public Service and would make the college councils their employers. She also had the ideal that staff with scarce skills could be lured out of industry to join these colleges. Unfortunately the department has failed the college councils with the implementation of this Act.</p>
            <p>Minister Nzimande, who apparently believes that everything and every one should be managed from Pretoria, is busy destroying that ideal. Instead of local communities being put in control of their colleges, these colleges are currently being transferred to the national department in Pretoria. Instead of greater flexibility and autonomy, our colleges will be forced into the narrow crush pen of government institutions.</p>
            <p>Each of our 50 public colleges is unique with regard to their staff needs and each of them requires a unique staff structure or organogram. The Public Service salary scales and the permanent organisational structure that will emanate from this Bill simply do not offer the flexibility that is needed to attract and keep competent college lecturers in scarce subjects.</p>
            <p>Public colleges, which had previously been a provincial responsibility, will now become the responsibility of a single national government department. The people who will be serving on these college councils, the way in which they will be managing their curricula, their language policies and their policies for appointing staff members, as well as the way in which many other important matters will work, will eventually be determined from Pretoria.</p>
            <p>In this process the powers of the college councils are being watered down, to the detriment of the students. This nationalisation of public colleges will result in the department having to open various provincial offices. Money that should have been utilised in the classrooms will now be wasted on provincial offices. In the process the cost with regard to training is once more being escalated significantly.</p>
            <p>Our country cannot afford this. For these reasons the DA cannot support this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]]</p>
            <p>Mr B M Bhanga: Chair, Cope again wants to register its position on the Further Education and Training Colleges Amendment Bill. We want to record that the technical amendments to the Bill proposed by the NCOP do not address our concerns about the Bill.</p>
            <p>We are, in principle, opposed to the notion that centralisation of powers in relation to the further education and training colleges will, of necessity, lead to improved management and control over these institutions. We will provide examples in terms of which the centralisation of power at the national level failed dismally.</p>
            <p>Cope believes that further education and training colleges should best be managed at the provincial level, which is closer to the communities that these institutions serve; and close to industries and businesses where those who graduate from these colleges will take up employment. The notion that national departments are better placed to oversee effective functioning of institutions is wrong.</p>
            <p>Centralisation cannot be offered as a panacea or magic wand to address administrative weaknesses at the provincial level. To the contrary, it is on record that many of the national departments, including the Department of Higher Education, do not support the notion that the centralisation of control and decision-making improves bodies that are overseen by national departments. Many national departments have become mired in controversy, including the Department of Higher Education.</p>
            <p>The problems encountered with the Sector Education and Training Authorities are a case in point. The Seta problems have increased rather than been resolved after they were placed under the control of the national department - under the leadership of former communist Mr Blade Nzimande. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]</p>
            <p>The National Student Financial Aid Scheme is another example. This financial aid scheme for students encountered problems that became worse after the former communist and his department effectively appropriated powers ... [Interjections.]</p>
            <p>Mrs M T Kubayi: I rise on a point of order, House Chair. I think the member who is speaking before us is not articulating the amendments to the Bill. We are dealing with the amendments to the Further Education and Training Bill, not with whether people are communists or not. Can we stick to that?</p>

            <p>Your point is noted. Hon member, let us stick to the Bill that is before us.</p>
            <p>Mr B M Bhanga: Our sense is that while the intentions of government may be good, what is contained in the Bill, proposed by the former Marxist, is going to take us in exactly the opposite direction. [Interjections.] With all that in mind, we as Cope cannot support this Bill. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Mr A M MPONTSHANE</from>
            <p>Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, I stand here to reaffirm our original position on the Bill when we debated it here before. We had some concerns regarding the Bill. Our first concern was the fact that these institutions were not equally resourced. It must be remembered that during the time of the merger, the commission that was charged with the shape and size of these institutions had instructions to reduce the number of institutions, but not to reduce the site of learning in these institutions, with which we agreed.</p>
            <p>In reality, we found that the satellite institutions were poorly resourced. Some time ago - and the Minister agreed - I referred to some of these institutions being, in fact, haunted. Take, for instance, KwaGqikazi College: no quality learning can take place in that institution.</p>
            <p>The second concern that we raised with regard to these institutions was that lecturers in these FETs were poorly qualified. We did raise our concern that, while we support the Bill, we urge the Minister to please see to it that the standard of lecturers in these institutions is raised. I thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#mr-k-j-dikobo">
            <from>Mr K J DIKOBO</from>
            <p>Hon Chairperson, hon members, Azapo's position on provinces is known, namely that provinces should be abolished and that South Africa should have a two-tier system of government, which would be national and local government. We will therefore support any move that takes away powers from provinces, whether it is the Further Education and Training Colleges Amendment Bill or putting certain provincial departments under administration. In fact, Azapo's view is that all provinces should be put under section 100 as part of the transition towards their abolition.</p>
            <p>Of course, we share the concerns about the disparity of the conditions of service of lecturers at FET colleges. We subscribe to the principle that conditions must be the same if you have the same employer and do the same work. So, we support the view that the Minister must deal with those disparities while, at the same time, dealing with the question of empowering college lecturers.</p>
            <p>Hon members will remember that some of those lecturers at FET colleges were actually drawn from colleges of education that were disestablished. So, many of them do not necessarily have experience in the field in which they are involved. That is the reason Azapo supports this Bill. We thank you. [Applause.]</p>

            <p>Hon Chairperson, as the ANC we support the amendment of the Further Education and Training Bill. We believe that this Bill seeks to assign and transfer all functions of the further education and training colleges from the provincial departments to the national department. We strongly believe that the national department is competent to do the task that is supposed to be done.</p>
            <p>Yes, we hear the opposition, especially the DA, talking about the poor performance of the FET colleges. We agree with them on that, but that is why we strongly believe that the introduction of this Bill is going to cater for dealing with such poor performance. We believe that the transitional period, that is when the FET colleges are in the process of being transferred to the national department, will be well managed. We know what most of the fears are that the people have. We are talking about the salaries and benefits of the employees; and we are talking about the lives of these people in terms of which as a country we need to provide people with skills. We know that that is a critical point. We know why the opposition is saying that. It is a concern of ours as the ANC too.</p>
            <p>As the ANC we strongly believe that this sector needs to be given enough attention. We want to produce a skilled and capable workforce for the economic growth of the country. So, really, as the ANC we fully support the transfer of the FET colleges to being a national competence. We believe that this sector is going to be more stable and that the transition period is going to be well managed. Thank you very much. [Applause.]</p>

            <from>Ms B N DAMBUZA</from>
            <p>Hon House Chairperson, Deputy President, hon members and honoured guests, the Department of Human Settlements hereby tables the Rental Housing Amendment Bill, Bill 21 of 2011, before Parliament in the National Assembly, in terms of section 76 of the Constitution. The Bill is classified by the Joint Tagging Mechanism as a section 76 Bill and has been referred to the Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements for consideration and report. The Bill seeks to address specific issues, including the establishment of rental housing tribunals, which are mandatory in every province.</p>
            <p>Having considered the objectives of the content of the Bill, the portfolio committee embarked on extensive deliberations and consideration of the public submissions and reached consensus that there was a great need to propose further amendments to the Act, which would be incorporated into the proposed Bill.</p>
            <p>The amendments will make the Act more accessible to all citizens and it will respond broadly to the challenges faced in the rental housing sector, thereby ensuring a better life for all. Therefore, the committee recommends that the House grant permission in terms of the National Assembly Rule 249(3)(b) for it to make consequential amendments to the Rental Housing Act, Act 50 of 1999. It is also worth noting that the proposed amendments will not affect the tagging of the Bill. The committee's proposals have been communicated to the responsible executive authority. We request the consideration of the Report. I thank you. [Applause.] There was no debate.</p>

          <speech by="#mr-h-t-magama">
            <from>Mr H T MAGAMA</from>
            <p>House Chair, Mr Deputy President and hon members, the purpose of the oversight visit of the committee to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia was threefold. The committee's mandate to hold the Department of International Relations and Co-operation to account extends to conducting oversight visits on the activities of South African missions abroad, amongst other things. One, the mission's role is to enhance the country's profile; two, to implement government policy abroad; and, three, to serve as strategic mechanisms for the achievement of our national interests in carrying out the mandate of the department.</p>
            <p>The committee assessed the department's performance in its mission in Addis Ababa in execution of South Africa's foreign policy, both at a multilateral and bilateral level in terms of country to country. The oversight extended to the African Union to assess South Africa's performance within the continental organisation structures and in furtherance of the African agenda, noting that South Africa is one of the single biggest contributors to the AU budget, this to the tune of 15%, later reduced to 13,5%, which roughly constitutes about 16% of the AU office budget in the amount of about R127 million. It is to be further noted that South Africa has committed itself to strengthening the AU and its subsidiary structures at a head-of-government summit level.</p>
            <p>The extent of South Africa's bilateral relations with Ethiopia was also assessed and the committee met with its parliamentary counterpart in Ethiopia to initiate dialogue since both these countries are key regional players involved in various continental engagements. Our counterpart, I might report, clearly stipulated the desire to forge closer relations between the two parliaments. To this end, the committee report contains a number of recommendations, which we present to the House today. Thank you very much. [Applause.]</p>

          <speech by="#mrs-y-r-botha">
            <from>Mrs Y R BOTHA</from>
            <p>Hon House Chairperson, Deputy President, the committee visited the Eastern Cape from 27 June to 1 July. As the portfolio committee our strategic objective was to monitor the achievement of government priorities for social development.</p>
            <p>The objectives of the oversight visit were therefore to assess the following: the extent to which the provincial department of social development aligned its strategic priorities with the national priorities; the extent to which the old-age homes implemented and complied with the Older Persons Act; the performance of National Development Agency-funded projects and projects funded by the Department of Social Development; and, lastly, the performance of the SA Social Security Agency, Sassa with regard to the implementation of the child support grant, the old age grant, the implementation of the integrated community registration outreach programme and conditions at the service areas and paypoints.</p>
            <p>The committee found in our interaction with the provincial government that they had implemented the key strategic national priorities, which were welfare services for children, women, people with disabilities, people affected and infected by HIV and Aids, and also, very importantly, family preservation.</p>
            <p>The oversight visits to the projects funded by the department showed that these projects had had a positive impact on the lives of the people. Through the use of home community-based care workers the services of the department were able to reach people in the most rural of areas. Furthermore, the projects did not only contribute to the wellbeing of families, but also contributed to the department's response to the government's goal of job creation, especially for the youth and women.</p>
            <p>The committee also found that the Isibindi Model of Care for Vulnerable Children and Youth implemented by the National Association of Child and Youth Care Workers provided a good model for the implementation of child and youth care services, which are aimed at child-headed households.</p>
            <p>What we found during our visit to several developmental welfare projects was that the migration of skilled workers, especially social workers, between provinces was a challenge. We also found when we interacted with beneficiaries and stakeholders that there was a need for specific court dates to be set aside for the court to review and finalise court orders for the foster care grant.</p>
            <p>In terms of home community-based care, the committee found that workers must receive training from the Department of Social Development because the volunteers from the project that we interacted with had not received any training.</p>
            <p>In terms of project management - the projects we visited that are funded by the NDA and the department - we felt that there was a major lack of capacity-building in these projects. Also, when it came to financial management, we felt that issues such as filing, capacity-building and space for these NGOs and projects to flourish were quite a challenge</p>
            <p>We found the park homes we visited that serve as offices for social services as well as for Sassa in Elliotdale to be inadequate and undignified and the toilets were not working. Although a new building was in progress, we felt that the current situation impacted on the dignity of our people and also on confidentiality when clients came to see social workers or when they came to see Sassa regarding the application for grants.</p>
            <p>Between August and now we met with Sassa and they gave us a briefing on the integrated service delivery model. We also received a report about the closure of the filing depot in Mthatha. They had to close it, because it wasn't conducive to work.</p>
            <p>Regarding those alternative arrangements and proactive issues, we have already interacted with them on that. We hope that the stringent implementation of the integrated service delivery model in the Eastern Cape will reap the right benefits. Thank you, hon Chairperson.</p>

          <heading id="dbsh44">CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HOME AFFAIRS ON OVERSIGHT VISIT TO NORTH WEST FROM 25 TO 29 JULY 2011</heading>
          <speech by="#mrs-m-m-maunye">
            <from>Mrs M M MAUNYE</from>
            <p>Hon Chair, Deputy President, Ministers, Deputy Ministers, comrades, hon members, in undertaking the oversight visit to the North West province, the committee used as a touchstone the department's vision of "a safe, secure South Africa that all its people are proud of, and value, their identity and citizenship and mission", and its mission of "the efficient determination and safeguarding of the identity and status of citizens and the regulation of migration to ensure security, promote development and fulfil our internal obligations".</p>
            <p>The committee therefore sought to assess the extent of the manifestation of the vision and mission of the department as per the constitutional mandate. Issues of capacity, security, integrity of identity and immigration management were the focus of the committee as it visited both ports of entry and other offices, which is generally inadequate in terms of the requisite equipment and poor infrastructure in order for service delivery to be expedited.</p>
            <p>We recommend that transport be provided to offices and ports of entry to facilitate efficient access to people in remote areas. In collaboration with the SA Revenue Service, the department should install scanners at the said border posts and provide passport live-capturing machines in offices.</p>
            <p>We recommend that the department comply with access specifications for people living with disabilities.</p>
            <p>The lack of communication of the Home Affairs border offices' system with each other and other relevant departments resulted in a lack of constant in- immigration control.</p>
            <p>The North West's borders were, at the time, virtually porous as they were manned by the police. We recommend that the SA National Defence Force be deployed to the North West's borders and that the communication network be enhanced. In the main in farm areas there were people with children without certificates, adults without identity documents and others carrying TBVC - Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei - identity documents. There were cases of duplicate IDs in some offices and the turnaround time in others was unacceptably low. We recommend that the matter of duplicate identity numbers and the backlog in farm areas be speedily addressed.</p>
            <p>The committee is concerned about border security as it impacts directly on the quality of lives of citizens. We are concerned that those who need social services because they are the most vulnerable - those most affected by poverty - have no access to the socioeconomic rights assured them by our government. We are concerned that our people do not receive the same quality of service throughout the country.</p>
            <p>We are also concerned when identity number duplications prevent legitimate beneficiaries from accessing insurance benefits. However, we pledge our support to the department as it endeavours to discharge its mandate and realise its vision and mission. We hope that the report will be endorsed by the Office of the Chief Whip.</p>

            <from>Mrs H H MALGAS</from>
            <p>Hon Chairperson, hon Deputy President, our hon Ministers and our Deputy Ministers, hon members and comrades, having conducted an oversight visit to full-service and special schools in the North West and Mpumalanga and having considered issues that are highlighted in the report in the Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports, the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education recommends the following actions.</p>
            <p>One, the national Department of Basic Education, together with the provincial education departments, should intensify teacher training in the specialised area of special needs and take into account the varying levels of training needs of the different schools; two, the national Department of Basic Education, together with the provincial departments of education, should expedite and scale up the implementation of the curriculum that responds to the skills subjects offered in special schools; three, given that transport is one of the keys to access, it is critical that the provincial education departments, together with the Department of Transport, make transport arrangements to ensure that learners with special needs are able to travel to and from school.</p>
            <p>Transport subsidies must be one of the components of the budget of full- service in special schools. The national department, together with the provincial education departments, should deliver timeously to schools sufficient learner and teacher-support material, including workbooks.</p>
            <p>The national department should make representations to ensure that sign language becomes an official language in order to enhance quality learning and teaching. The committee requests Parliament to adopt the report of this committee. Thank you.</p>

          <p>1. Report of Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements on oversight visit to the Western Cape, dated 14 April 2010</p>
          <p>The Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements, having undertaken an oversight to the Western Cape from 31 January to 5 February 2010, reports as follows:</p>
          <p>1. Background</p>
          <p>The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996, as well as parliamentary rules, mandates parliamentary committees to exercise oversight over any executive organ of state that falls within their respective portfolios. The Committee undertook an oversight visit to the Western Cape to oversee the following:</p>
          <p>. Implementation of a Comprehensive Integrated Human Settlements Strategy in the province. . Quality of housing units to ensure an alignment of allocated expenditure, as well as meeting service delivery targets set for 2008/09. . The plans, programmes and service delivery targets for 2009/10. . The number of informal settlements: the plans and progress in upgrading such settlements, including the Community Residential Units (CRUs). . The role of the public and private sectors in human settlements service delivery. . The co-ordination and management of the beneficiary list and the incorporation of backyard dwellers onto the provincial housing database. . The use of alternative technologies on projects. . Further issues on: o Reports on communities affected by disasters; delays in projects and plans and solutions; and progress and plans on the rectification programme; implementation of the Farm Workers Assistance Programme</p>
          <p>The parliamentary delegation consisted of Ms BN Dambuza (leader of the delegation (ANC)); Mr MR Mdakane (ANC); Ms TMA Gasebonwe (ANC); Mr Matshoba (ANC); Ms NA Mnisi (ANC) ; Ms V Bam-Mugwanya; Mr AM Figlan (DA) ; Mr AC Steyn (DA) and Mr T Botha (COPE).</p>
          <p>The delegation was also accompanied by officials from the National Department of Human Settlements, i.e. Ms J Bayat, Mr L Jolobe and Ms N Tembani. Provincial departmental officials included Ms J Samson, Mr R Smith, Mr V Tshose and Ms N Hadi. The Knysna Municipality was represented by the Executive Mayor, Ms E Bouw-Spies, Mr JB Douglas, (Municipal Manager); Ms L Waring and Mr D Kemetie. Parliamentary support staff included Ms K Pasiya (Committee Secretary) and Mr F Bulawa (Committee Assistant). 2. Overview of briefings and oversight activities</p>
          <p>Sunday, 31 January 2010</p>
          <p>2.1 Meeting in Knysna Municipal Offices</p>
          <p>The provincial Department of Human Settlement's Chief Director, Planning and Development, Ms J Samson, welcomed the delegation. She tendered an apology on behalf of the MEC, Hon. B Madikizela, who was unable to meet with the delegation.</p>
          <p>Opening remarks by Ms BN Dambuza: Overview and objective of oversight visit</p>
          <p>Ms BN Dambuza thanked the Provincial Department, as well as all who attended the meeting. She indicated that whilst the apology from the MEC was both noted and accepted, it would have been empowering if the delegation was welcomed by the public representative. She, however, expressed her appreciation to the MEC for assistance provided to the Committee in order to undertake oversight in the province. She further indicated that an apology was also submitted by Mr M Dlabantu, Acting Director-General of the National Department of Human Settlements.</p>
          <p>Ms Dambuza proceeded to indicate that the objectives of the oversight visit are in line with the parliamentary mandate:</p>
          <p>. To oversee projects, and ascertain whether there was value for money in undertaking all projects. . To evaluate the impact of government programmes on the lives of the people In conclusion, Ms Dambuza stated that in 2004, the Department adopted a new strategy, called Breaking New Ground (BNG). This strategy promotes the establishment of integrated and sustainable human settlements. The aspect of housing was further highlighted in the 2009 State of the Nation Address. This focus was on reversing the trend of further exacerbating spatial marginalisation of the poor by achieving new modes of intergovernmental integration.</p>
          <p>Presentation by Ms J Samson: Chief Director Planning Briefing on the provincial Strategic Plan</p>
          <p>The presentation highlighted that the provincial department was:</p>
          <p>. Accelerating the provision of housing opportunity, including the prioritisation of services-sites. The provincial Department would upscale the provision and implementation of service-sites and to reduce bulk infrastructure as a constraint to human settlement development. . Inculcating a sense of ownership and responsibility amongst housing beneficiaries, tenants and owners. The Department was planning to increase beneficiary involvement and educate owners, beneficiaries and tenants them on rights and responsibilities, as well as the development of housing opportunities. . Developing a standardised, transparent and fair policy processes for the selection of housing beneficiaries. . Optimising the use of resources and partnership to increase the density of new housing developments on well located land, and increasing private/public sector partnerships. . Introducing a coordinated approach to human settlements through effective Integrated Development Planning (IDP) or human settlements planning. The Department will assist potential municipalities to become accredited as housing developers. . Establishing a fully functional department capacitated to deliver services. Ms Samson also raised the following key issues:</p>
          <p>. The Province has a housing demand database support programme. The aim is to support non-metro municipalities to strengthen housing demand data collection and management systems and practices. The database will be on a needs-based register, indicating an applicant's profile. . The Province will identify vulnerable informal and backyard settlements. Disaster, fire and floods would be the determiners of a risk management strategy. The Province has developed an informal settlement master plan, with clear plans for each identified informal settlement. . A database showing informal settlements, temporary settlements or relocation areas database will be collated. The Province would be able to accelerate in-site upgrading and develop recommendations to progressively provide all informal settlements with improved infrastructure and tenure. . The Department completed two sizeable projects under the rectification programme. Within the City of Cape Town, a total of 2 200 units were completed, while in George, approximately 400 units were phased within municipal housing allocations. . In the Western Cape, alternative technologies were used in the construction of the N2 Gateway project. The Danish Government donated R10 million for installation of solar water heaters, while thermally efficient material was utilised in some of the houses. ABSA bank administers a Show Village Competition which serves as an opportunity for showcasing various housing concepts. These were on display for evaluation by communities in Paarl. . With respect to performance on delivery targets, during the third quarter of 2009/10, the department managed to acquire and serviced 11 071 sites, and constructed 12 163 houses.</p>
          <p>The table below provides an overview of provincial expenditure during the 2009/10 financial year: Table 1: Expenditure for 2009/10 |Provincial allocation 2009/10 |Expenditure |Balance | |Programme |Amount in rands | | | |IHHSD |1 234 088 000 |934 775 520 |299 312 480 | |N2 Funding |250 000 000 |79 083 768 |170 916 232 | |Other programs |97 337 000 |67 870 884 |29 466 116 | |Total |1 581 425 000 |1 081 730 172 |499 694 828 |</p>
          <p>The provincial service delivery targets for all programmes for 2010/11 were to acquire approximately 18 156 serviced sites, to construct 15 457 houses and to construct 5 121 houses in other programmes.</p>
          <p>Deliberations</p>
          <p>Members of the delegation raised the following issues:</p>
          <p>. The current status of the provincial housing database was queried, and whether there was a collaborative link between the three spheres of government? . The lack of capacity in municipalities, and whether how the Province provides assistance to the regional offices and regional team offices? The current situation with regard to the accreditation of municipalities was also questioned. . The installation of services in dense settlements. . The number of informal settlements. . Plans to assist farm worker and or farm dwellers, vulnerable groups and backyard dwellers. . The challenges posed by land shortages and whether the department had conducted a land audit. . Managing challenges related to the beneficiary list. . The status of in-situ upgrading of shacks.</p>
          <p>In response, the provincial department indicated that the previous database did not include a link to the three spheres of government. Instead, only the national Department was able to access the database. At the time of the oversight, Knysna was the only region that implemented a sound database. Furthermore, the department indicated that accreditation was currently in process, and there was a need to capacitate municipalities. Level one and two accreditation would be finalised by the end of 2010, while level three accreditation would require approval from National Treasury. The Department acknowledged that the vision of the Housing 20/30 strategy aimed to assist municipalities that had capacity challenges, especially in rare skills.</p>
          <p>The provincial Department indicated that there was a total of 715 informal settlements located across the province. The informal settlement upgrading process was prioritised through the provision of greenfield sites. The province was also using in-situ upgrading in the metro, where a total of 253 informal settlements had been upgraded. Across the province, there were about 550 informal settlements earmarked for in-situ upgrading.</p>
          <p>Farm workers were assisted through programmes implemented by municipalities, although there was no specific programme dedicated only to farm dwellers. The province acknowledged that the issue of farm workers continued to be a challenge, and argued that it was challenging and expensive to maintain or provide houses on farms. The province was, however, collaborating with the Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs to address the challenges of evictions of farm workers by farm owners. However, the province proposed that this issue would require a national response, since the province experienced farm evictions on a daily basis.</p>
          <p>It was indicated that the provincial Department of Human Settlements was in the process of developing a policy in relation to people with special needs, with assistance from provincial departments of Health and of Social Development. While houses were constructed for people with disabilities, the Association for the Blind registered objections to its specifications. The province was, however, in the process of improving this aspect of its housing programme.</p>
          <p>The province indicated that it regarded backyard dwellings as part of informal settlements. In this regard, a 50 m serviced sites were made available to build 40 m2 houses. However, the unavailability of well- located land was a significant challenge and required further attention. It was revealed that the provincial Department did not have a programme in place to address the issue of accessing land. However, a land audit was conducted on public and private land during 2006. It was suggested that the Housing Development Agency (HDA) should assist in land-related challenges, especially in acquiring prime land.</p>
          <p>The Mayor of Knysna, Ms Spies, informed the delegation that the area was further challenged by steep land, coupled with forestry villages that do not have access to basic services. For example, in Crystalfontein, forestry and Transnet land was very difficult to access, and the process took approximately three years to be finalised.</p>
          <p>The national Department mentioned that it considered different alternative energy- providing and construction technologies, such as the N2 Gateway project, where the Danish government sponsored R10 million for the installation of solar water heaters. The ABSA 'show village competition' involved developers across the globe in order to showcase and explore creativity and innovation in housing construction, together with energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>The sale of houses by beneficiaries was an obstacle to government in reaching its policy objectives. It was revealed that a study conducted showed that almost 50% of the beneficiaries were not staying their house in Du Noon. In George, about 90% of government-assisted houses were sold or illegally rented to foreign nationals, due to levels of poverty in the community. As such, it created a need to review relevant policies. While policy provisions made allowance for a minimum period of eight years before a beneficiary could sell a house, this had not been adhered to. The national department suggested the need for beneficiaries to be educated to perceive and use their houses as assets, while the issue of title deeds should be followed up. The national department specified that the backyard dwellers policy would be addressed at national level.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, Ms Dambuza requested a report from the Knysna municipality on land-related challenges, especially in the forestry and Transnet areas.</p>
          <p>Monday, 1 February 2010</p>
          <p>2.2 Meeting at Plettenberg Bay municipal offices</p>
          <p>The delegation was welcomed by the Mayor, Mr L Mvimbi. He informed the delegation that the municipality had a population of 7 000 people, 7 wards and 13 councillors. The municipality received a budget of R355 million for the 2009/10 financial year, of which R100 million had already been spent. The municipality had a housing backlog of approximately 1 200 units, while the municipality was faced with budgetary constraints. A total of five projects were implemented in the municipal area, ie:</p>
          <p>. Bossiesgif. . Kwanokuthula. . Bitou Emergency Housing project Project (EHP). . Kranshoek phase 2. . Kurtland phase 2.</p>
          <p>(a) Bossiesgif project</p>
          <p>The project to build 1 300 units was approved in August 2005. Phase 1 consisted of 265 serviced sites. By the time of the visit, more than 90% of the top structure had already been completed. In phase 2, bulk infrastructure was towards the completion of 540 units by February 2010. The entire budget for the project amounted to R 42 2000 00.</p>
          <p>The municipality encountered challenges with illegal occupants who forcefully occupied houses, and the municipality sought to obtain a court interdict for eviction. Another challenge relates to land that was very expensive for the purposes of either purchase or expropriation.</p>
          <p>(b) Kwanokuthula project</p>
          <p>The municipality received a conditional approval to build 2 000 units during 2008. The project was subsequently divided into four phases. The bulk infrastructure has been completed, and additional sites will be serviced by March 2010. Show houses were constructed. The closing date for submission of tenders in respect to the construction of top structures for 134 units in phase 1 was 1 February 2010. The municipality faced considerable pressure from the community to complete construction of the top structures. The municipality was, however, not in a position to complete this due to budgetary constraints, and indicated that it had already spent more than the funding allocated for the project.</p>
          <p>(c) Bitou Emergency Housing Project (EHP)</p>
          <p>The project was initiated in July 2008, after an assessment was completed on the houses damaged by storms in Green Valley and Kranshoek. The information was analysed and the cost estimates for the work was compiled. The project was valued at R16 million, and divided into six smaller projects to give opportunities to local contractors who upgraded at the lower end of the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) grading register;</p>
          <p>. Project 1 and 2: The construction of aprons around the houses was complete. At the time of the visit, the V-drain was under construction. . Project 3: Houses in Kranshoek had been repaired, plastered and painted. . Project 4: In Green Valley, 13 out of 15 houses that were demolished had been rebuilt, and others houses repaired. . Project 5: Upgrading of infrastructure of the Kranshoek project was delayed until additional funds were approved. Excavation for storm water drainage pipelines were under construction. . Project 6: Upgrading of civil services in Green Valley was terminated due to non-performance by the contractor and re-awarded to Ukhana Projects. Excavations for the storm water draining were under construction.</p>
          <p>Challenges encountered include that some of the houses were not registered, especially in Green Valley. Subsequently, additional resources were needed to ensure that unregistered houses were also repaired. Further, it was suggested that the capacity of local contractors required improvement.</p>
          <p>(d) Kranshoek phase 2</p>
          <p>Phase 1 of the project consisted of 400 units and had been completed. An application for 670 units was submitted to the province for approval. However, the application was rejected and returned to the municipality. The municipality budgeted for the installation of bulk infrastructure from its own funds for the 2009/10 capital budget. The application was for the construction of 235 units.</p>
          <p>The Mayor informed the delegation that the eradication of the housing backlog in Bitou was one of the major challenges that faced the municipality. The eradication of informal settlements and backyard dwellers would also assist in eradicating the housing backlog. The Mayor indicated that the municipality would ensure that informal settlements were eradicated and that people would be housed in habitable conditions. As such, this commitment served as the rationale for the municipality's plea for the approval of applications for top structure where services had been installed.</p>
          <p>The Mayor specified that the provincial allocations for housing delivery for the 2009/10 financial year was R11 million; the upgraded allocation for 2009/10 was R15 800 000 which brought the total for housing delivery to R26 800 000. The budget for the approved projects for 2009/10 was R30 821 192 of which R17 894 801 was not approved</p>
          <p>2.3 Site visits</p>
          <p>2.3.1 Bossiesgif</p>
          <p>It was pointed out that some beneficiaries started to move into their new houses during May 2009. The size of each house was 40 m. It was observed that the houses were of good quality, and had ventilation, a toilet and a shower. Retaining walls were built as part of the subsidy. Some sites were not yet allocated. However, the sites for schools and other amenities were identified. The delegation discussed the issue of densification with communities, who in turn agreed to relocate when advised to.</p>
          <p>2.3.2 Kwanokuthula 5 and 6</p>
          <p>With the approval of the National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC), a number of innovative show houses were built in Kwanokuthula. The delegation observed that people were temporarily occupying show houses, due to their homes that have been damaged by natural disasters.</p>
          <p>2.3.3 Flenters in Knysna</p>
          <p>The project was a managed People's Housing Process (PHP) where 790 houses were built as an in-situ upgrading. A tender was awarded to 12 emerging contractors for different phases. Roofs were tiled. The project was labour intensive with very high technical specifications. The project faced challenges related to topographical conditions.</p>
          <p>2.4 Briefing by the Deputy Mayor of Knysna</p>
          <p>The Deputy Mayor indicated that the municipality had a population of 68 000. The housing backlog on the waiting list constituted 8 000 beneficiaries. Some of the pre-1994 houses transferred to beneficiaries were damaged, and additional funding to rectify these houses was pending approval. There were no blocked projects in the area, and the NHBRC was involved in most of the projects. Social housing had a challenge of affordability, and the municipality was considering Community Residential Units (CRUs) in this regard. The waiting list, funding and the land issue were some of the challenges faced by the municipality.</p>
          <p>The Deputy Mayor requested the delegation's assistance with the following challenges faced by the municipality:</p>
          <p>. Upgrading of backyard dwellings in Hornlee. . Rectification of pre-1994 houses. . Additional funding required. . Acquisition of land. . Security of tenure. . Rural development. . Slow procurement processes.</p>
          <p>The delegation asked whether the municipality received more funding towards the end of the financial year (fiscal dumping), and what were the plans of the municipality in dealing with backyard dwellers. In response, the Deputy Mayor indicated that the municipality experienced fiscal dumping from the province; however the municipality managed to utilize it effectively.</p>
          <p>(a) Site visit to Pacaltzdorp</p>
          <p>The project was approved in 2007. The Mayor informed the delegation that the MEC was going to turn the sod on that day to kick start the project. The delegation congratulated the beneficiaries and reminded them that home ownership was a basic right. Beneficiaries were urged not to sell their houses, and to pay for basic services.</p>
          <p>The environment impact assessment (EIA) process took over four years to be approved. The houses to be constructed will be 40 m, with a tiled roof and ceiling. However, the area experienced water-related challenges.</p>
          <p>On turning the sod, the MEC thanked the parliamentary delegation, the Acting Mayor and officials representing both the national and provincial departments.</p>
          <p>Ms Dambuza acknowledged the municipality for its coordination of the beneficiary list. She argued that delays in the EIAs, which hampered progress in most projects, were a critical issue. She further encouraged beneficiaries not to sell their houses, and the municipality in turn to educate beneficiaries to understand the cost associated with constructing houses.</p>
          <p>The MEC then officially initiated a new project through the turning of the sod.</p>
          <p>2.5 Complaints from the local councillors in Pacaltzdorp</p>
          <p>The councillors complained that it was mostly coloured people who benefited from the Pacaltzdorp project. They further suggested that the list of beneficiaries was not co-ordinated. They argued that, there were only 35 beneficiaries from Thembalethu, and those 35 beneficiaries were not informed and not invited for the turning of the sod event. Ms Dambuza assured the councillors that the matter would be referred to the Minister and the Acting Mayor to be addressed, and thereafter to be reported on to the Committee. A special meeting would be arranged to address issues raised by the councillors.</p>
          <p>2.6 Meeting at Great Brak Municipal Offices</p>
          <p>The delegation was welcomed by the Deputy Mayor, Mr H Levendal. The delegation was informed that all services were completed by December 2005. This constituted phase 1, with 210 subsidies, and phase 2, with 462 subsidies. The contractor had established a presence on the site, while the construction of foundations would begin in early 2010. However, due to the steepness of the area, geotechnical excavation was very expensive. During phase 2, progress was delayed by approximately four months due to the late enrolment of the project by the NHBRC.</p>
          <p>The municipality was applying a strategy to collaborate with two contractors. The one contractor would deal with soil preparation, while the other with the top structure. Main contractors subcontracted with local contractors, and employed local people as labourers.</p>
          <p>It was a challenge to acquire land that stretched over even terrain, and the province was approached for additional funding. The national Department was requested to reconsider funding to communities located in areas where the topography was steep and uneven.</p>
          <p>Deliberations</p>
          <p>The delegation sought clarity on the following:</p>
          <p>. The site for Community Residential Units (CRUs). . Gap market houses. . Pre-1994 housing stock. . The role of the private sector. . Issues of migration.</p>
          <p>The municipality applied for the upgrading of CRUs. Furthermore, while migration patterns into the area were manageable, communities such as Mossel Bay experienced a considerable challenge due to rapid growth. The challenges of the backyard dwellers were addressed, and there were 12 000 beneficiaries on the waiting list.</p>
          <p>2.7 Brief presentation by the Chairperson of Community Housing of Great Brak Municipality</p>
          <p>Challenges faced by communities in the area were identified as follows:</p>
          <p>. Houses built in close proximity to a dam could pose a health hazard to the surrounding community. . Non-payment or very low salaries paid by contractors to workers. . Allegations that white contractors obtained more contracts to build houses compared to black contractors. . Requests were made for assistance in accessing land for churches. . There were few schools, clinics, police stations, and no social amenities for the community.</p>
          <p>Ms Dambuza reported that an engagement between the MEC, national Department and the municipality would be arranged to assist with addressing the challenges faced by communities in the area. She further requested the municipality to intervene and to deal with contractors who were exploiting the people. She indicated that a meeting between councillors, contractors, as well as the community would be organised where all the challenges would be discussed.</p>
          <p>(a) Site visit to Wolwedans project</p>
          <p>The site was serviced in 2005, and top structures were completed in 2009. It was divided into 2 sections, namely the upgrading of informal settlements consisting of 211 units, and the greenfield project. The greenfield project was mainly intended for backyard dwellers and consisted of 466 units. The top structures were enrolled with the NHBRC. All 677 sites were serviced, 20 of the top structures would be roofed by February 2010, and the remaining ones by April 2012.</p>
          <p>Houses were electrified, fitted with solar geysers, and were constructed with tiled roofs. When beneficiaries moved into the houses, their shacks would be demolished. During construction, backyard dwellers would be relocated to a temporary relocation area (TRA).</p>
          <p>During the delegation's interaction with members of the community, individuals raised concerns regarding the possible threat of the dam located in close proximity to their houses. In particular, the community expressed the threat of the dam to their children's safety. Members of the community requested the delegation's intervention in recommending that the dam should be fenced with a high wall. The community also alleged that the person heading the housing programme in the area was marginalised and not informed about housing initiatives. The community also accused the municipality of being racist in its approach to certain group of people.</p>
          <p>Challenges identified The topography of the area, i.e. steep slopes, put additional strain on the available budget. The municipality contributed towards the servicing of the sites.</p>
          <p>(b) Site visit to Joe Slovo - Khayelitsha Ward 2</p>
          <p>The project started in 1996 with the building of 529 units as a People's Housing Process (PHP) project, through the Utshani Trust Fund. Under PHP management 167 top structures were completed, while 327 top structures were constructed by a contractor. To date, the project had 35 outstanding units. The project ceased operation in 2001 due to an investigation into the Utshani Fund. At the time of the visit, the municipality had advertised for a suitable candidate to take up the position of project manager to manage the process of unblocking the project, as well as other projects such as Highway and Civic Park.</p>
          <p>The delegation was further informed by the ward councillor that an application for the rectification of units was approved by the Minister. Five hundred units would be demolished and an assessment was undertaken by Thubelisha. The Deputy Mayor, however, made a contradictory statement by indicating that 120 units would be demolished.</p>
          <p>The Deputy Mayor indicated that an in-situ project in Elangeni was stopped in 2008 due to inferior workmanship presented by the initial contractor. The second contractor acknowledged that progress on the project was slow, but committed that by the end of March 2010, work would be complete.</p>
          <p>Houses in Khayelitsha were constructed in a format that resembled a garage, which included a toilet. It was further suggested that houses were not fitted with proper infrastructure, and as a result sewerage systems were blocked. It was further arleged that walls were erected on inadequate foundations. In some instances, beneficiaries were expected to complete incomplete units themselves. The following contractors were involved in the projects: New Core (who later changed to Melon), MK, ASLA and Lewis (who accepted funding for nine units which it did not construct).</p>
          <p>(c) Site visit: Joe Slovo- Khayelitsha Ward 12</p>
          <p>It was reported that the project came to a halt in 1997 when the contractor vanished after being paid to construct 33 PHP houses. The contractor was supposed to construct 527 units. However, the contractor only completed five units, of which some were destroyed by strong winds. The municipality has since appointed a project manager, M vd Harris Construction, from Durban.</p>
          <p>The delegation voiced its approval of the size of the units, but expressed concern about the quality of construction, as well as completion of the project.</p>
          <p>(d) Site visit Joe Slovo-Zinyoka and Asazani informal settlement</p>
          <p>It was reported that the in-situ upgrading was supposed to start in 2006 in accordance with a council resolution. However, the Record of Decision was not approved in time, while EIA was not conducted. The municipality set aside R6.5 million for the construction of access roads. The community was informed that it would be relocated to the identified land.</p>
          <p>The community, however, alleged that the municipality was trying to move people away from the well-located land to the periphery. They further argued that the municipality wanted to build flats in that area in its own interest instead. The community alleged that it was not consulted during the process, and that the municipality implemented decisions without its input. Furthermore, the youth did not benefit from development initiatives in the area.</p>
          <p>In 2008, the area was affected by a natural disaster, and 13 houses were subsequently destroyed. Members of the community whose houses were destroyed claimed that they did not receive any assistance in this regard. They suggested that Glentana, a place of residence for white people which was also affected by the same disaster, was rebuilt in the same year. Community members claimed that while land was available for private sale, it was not the case for public developments.</p>
          <p>It was reported that the ASLA contractor built 2 700 houses in Ward 3 during 2008. However, these units still did not have a water supply, electricity, or toilets. The roofs of these houses leaked when it rained, and the houses were not divided. They were, therefore, not suitable for families because of a lack of privacy.</p>
          <p>Observations by the committees</p>
          <p>. Community members did not trust the municipality and the delegation recommended that, the matter be addressed. . A task team, comprising of senior officials from the national and provincial government departments, as well as the municipality and the community members, should be formed within two weeks. This team could investigate and address the challenges confronting the project. . The portfolio committee will have to be briefed on the findings of the task team.</p>
          <p>Tuesday, 2 February 2010 2.8 Meeting at Beaufort West Municipal Offices</p>
          <p>The delegation was welcomed by the Mayor, Ms Jonas.</p>
          <p>The following key issues were highlighted for the area:</p>
          <p>. The population size was 37 000, with an unemployment rate of 39%. . The housing backlog stood at 3 093 units, while the municipality received an allocation of R3 million for the delivery of houses. . The municipality consisted of 7 wards and 13 councillors. . Subsidies did not cover costs for infrastructure, and funding for bulk infrastructure was inadequate. . A municipal infrastructure grant (MIG) was not allocated to the Karoo. . The area experienced a water shortage. . Soil conditions were unsuitable for digging trenches. Large pieces of machinery were required, which due to their cost, were unaffordable to the municipality.</p>
          <p>(a) Site visit to Hillside l</p>
          <p>During the first phase of the project, 512 housing units were built. The units were 36 m in size, with no dividing walls. Units were not equipped with a shower and did not have ventilation ducts or proper electrification. It consisted of a bean structure joined by bricks.</p>
          <p>The delegation recommended that the contractor be instructed to rectify the defects.</p>
          <p>During the second phase of the project, 598 houses were built. They were 40 m in size, with two bedrooms and a shower (although no geyser was installed). The contract was awarded to ASLA. At the time of the visit, all the beneficiaries had already moved into their houses.</p>
          <p>Challenges identified</p>
          <p>The beneficiaries were selling or leasing their houses, despite the existence of the pre-emptive clause, which prohibited such practices.</p>
          <p>(b) Site visit to Rustdene</p>
          <p>The delegation was informed that the project was going construct 270 one- bedroom units (pre-1994). The units were mostly occupied by elderly people. The challenge was that the houses did not have indoor toilets. This made it difficult for the elderly people to access the toilets, especially at night and when it rained. There was an urgent need for rectification in this regard.</p>
          <p>(c) Site visit to Mandlenkosi-Xhoxha area</p>
          <p>It was reported that the project was started in 1988 and completed in 1990, i.e. during the time of the previous Bantu Administration. A total of fifty five houses were built, but were never transferred to beneficiaries. In addition, the houses were in a very poor condition, i.e. a state of deterioration. Challenges included leaking roofs, lack of flooring and ventilation. These units were not upgradeable, but required demolition and reconstruction.</p>
          <p>(d) Site visit to Merveville It was indicated that the project had 90 approved units, of which 50% had already been completed. Subsidies for 90 beneficiaries were screened and approved by the Department. The original number of units for the project was 100, but 10 of the beneficiaries opted for the PHP instead. Applications for the PHP were submitted to the Department and a decision was awaited. The delegation was informed that housing consumer education had been conducted in the area.</p>
          <p>2.9 Meeting at Laingsburg Municipal Offices</p>
          <p>The delegation was received by the Mayor, Ms Rukeya Meyer.</p>
          <p>The following information was highlighted:</p>
          <p>. The total population of Laingsburg totaled 7 330. . The municipality comprised six councillors, but did not have any wards. . Agriculture and accommodation were the main viable economic activities in Laingsburg and provided a sustainable income. . Two housing projects were implemented by the municipality. The Matjiesfontein project was conditionally approved, i.e. an application for 95 units was submitted, but only 39 units had been approved. The second project comprised 302 units and was in the planning stage. . The municipality was registered to receive the Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG). However, it had a backlog of 450 units. In 2008, 180 units were built by a Moladi constructor. . The municipality's target was to build 108 units per year. . The municipality operated 42 units for rental and receives full monthly rent.</p>
          <p>It was reported that the shortage of land was a challenge, and that while the municipality purchased some land, it was later discovered that it was not suitable for the construction of housing units. The municipality consequently took a decision to rezone the land for the use of farming.</p>
          <p>(a) Site visit to Laingsburg phase 1</p>
          <p>The project was started in 1999 and was completed in 2000. It had 320 units, with a size of 32 m. The units had one bedroom, a bath and an indoor toilet. Beneficiaries owned the title deeds.</p>
          <p>(b) Site visit to Laingsburg phase 2</p>
          <p>The project involved the construction of 40 m units, which were built by local residents. The streets were also constructed by local residents through the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP).</p>
          <p>(c) Matjiesfontein</p>
          <p>The delegation could not visit the area due to time constraints, but was informed that the municipality had applied for 95 units. However, only 39 units had been approved.</p>
          <p>It was recommended that a follow-up visit would be conducted to this community.</p>
          <p>Challenges</p>
          <p>. Acquiring suitable land. . The municipality experienced budgetary constraints. . Many people in the area were unemployed, resulting in extremely low income levels.</p>
          <p>Wednesday, 3 February 2010</p>
          <p>2.10 Meeting at De Doorns Municipal Offices</p>
          <p>The Mayor, Mr C Ntsomi, councillors and municipal officials welcomed the delegation.</p>
          <p>The following overview was provided:</p>
          <p>. The municipality was divided into 20 wards with 39 councillors. . The population size was 139 000. . A total of six informal settlements were located in the municipality, of which some are located on river beds, flood lines, and on the edge of power lines. . In Zwelethemba, sites were serviced, sanitation was installed and water points were available. . De Doorns was allocated a budget amounting to R25 million to speed up the Upgrading of Informal Settlement Programme (UISP) process and to develop 577 new sites. . The xenophobia attacks on 17 November 2009 were as a result of the influx of Zimbabwean nationals (about 1 200 persons) to De Doorns who were looking for employment opportunities during the harvest period. . The De Doorns Xenophobia Relocation Project began on 17 November 2009. There were 180 families affected, consisting of 1 440 older persons, 180 children and 800 adults. Affected persons were placed temporarily in a safety- camp at the De Doorns sports field. They have been provided with communal toilets (180 in total) and water by the Breede Valley and Cape Winelands District Municipalities. The cost of the toilet supply was R30 709 per week. The provincial government was assisting in paying the costs. The cost of the security was R11 400 per month. The displaced individuals had been provided with temporary shelter by through UNCHR tents. The integration plans were in the process, but had been taking longer than initially anticipated. . In terms of the eviction of farm workers, the municipality was only assisting by registering them on the waiting list. . The municipality was in the process of upgrading 39 old hostels in Worcester. In Worcester alone, the waiting list was approximately 13 000. In Zwelethemba, 331 housing units had been constructed through the PHP, of which 170 were completed. . In Rawsonville, 490 beneficiaries were on a waiting list. The municipality had purchased land. Rawsonville was confronted by the challenge of Eskom's resistance to remove power lines that were lying over the purchased land. . In Touwsriver, there were 1000 units that needed to be demolished as some contained dangerous structural defects. . About 800 rectified houses still required rebuilding as rectification worsened structural defects, but the provincial department had not approved funding for that project.</p>
          <p>The municipality had 1 000 serviced sites, and 780 units would be built in Avian Park. Eight of these were affected by floods and required reconstruction. An amount of R135 000 was allocated for the upgrading and refurbishment of CRUs. Due to the rural nature of the municipal area, the level of employment was reported to be low.</p>
          <p>Deliberations</p>
          <p>The delegation sought clarity on the following key issues:</p>
          <p>. The number of informal settlements in the area. . An issue was raised on whether the provincial Department committed any fiscal dumping and provided the municipality with additional funding for programmes towards the end of the financial year.</p>
          <p>The municipality informed the delegation that the waiting list comprised 7 000 from the informal settlements. The province confirmed that Breede Valley Municipality had been proactive in providing bulk infrastructure, whereas some other municipalities that received funds experienced difficulties to even start the project. The province recommended that the municipality should receive R60 million in addition to its R30 million of the normal allocation to equal to R90 million.</p>
          <p>(a) Site visit to the refugee site</p>
          <p>It was observed that the ground hosted 300 tents. Each tent was occupied by six people. In the ground there were 95 toilets, six showers and five taps. The tents were sponsored by the UNCHR. To monitor and control access to the site, the municipality issued cards to people. The personnel from the clinic visited the site on a fortnightly basis.</p>
          <p>(b)Site visit to Stoflani Informal Settlement</p>
          <p>The settlement existed since 2006. There was a need to plan for in-situ upgrading.</p>
          <p>Challenges Local emerging contractors alleged that they were not given contracts. They argued that contracts were only awarded to ASLA and Khulani. Another challenge was that most of the shacks in the area were located on the flood line.</p>
          <p>(c)Site visit to Masero Informal Settlement</p>
          <p>It was reported that the Masero informal settlement was located on private farm land. Most of the residents were immigrants from Lesotho, arriving during the grape harvest season. The settlement did not have proper water connections and the existing water pipes were connected illegally. It was alleged that some of residents owned more than one shack, which they were leasing to others.</p>
          <p>(d)Site visit to Ekuphumleni Rectification and Rental Project</p>
          <p>It was observed that this site had 96 new units for rental, which were in good condition. The delegation expressed concern that a person with a disability was required to pay a rental fee from the disability grant, instead of being accommodated by the municipality.</p>
          <p>2.11 Meeting at Drankenstein Municipal Offices</p>
          <p>The delegation was welcomed by the Mayor, Ms C Manuels.</p>
          <p>The following key issues were raised:</p>
          <p>. The municipality acted as an agency for the provincial and national departments. . In 2006, a total of 25 000 beneficiaries on the waiting list represented the lowest income group, while 550 came from the middle -income group. . The municipality requested funding amounting to R27 million in order to fund gap housing, and was awaiting a response.</p>
          <p>The municipality was approached by ABSA Innovation Resources to administer an international competition aimed at showcasing various housing concepts. The target market was middle-income homeowners. ABSA appointed Orikon to manage the project. The following categories would be evaluated: durability, architectural structure, cost, energy efficiency, social acceptance, rapid construction, and bank acceptability and finance.</p>
          <p>In terms of its role to ensure the success of this competition, the municipality committed to contribute the following:</p>
          <p>. Erf 3 320 was set aside in Wellington, and 333 sites were prepared to construct the houses. . Agreements, role and responsibilities were in place, which will be perused by the municipal legal advisor. . The project steering committee was formed and consultations with beneficiaries were conducted.</p>
          <p>A total of 51 entries were received, and 25 houses would be constructed. At the time of the visit, some of the units were completed. These would be handed over to beneficiaries on 9 February 2010, while the winner of the competition would be announced during March 2010.</p>
          <p>It was reported that consumer education was conducted extensively for the beneficiaries of the show village units. Beneficiaries without attendance certificates for the training would not receive a unit.</p>
          <p>It was further reported that a blocked project had 835 units. ASLA developed a greenfield where 1 661 units were constructed. In addition, a total of 766 units were developed in partnership with the Mellon Foundation. In Dube, 2 000 units were constructed, of which 181 were illegally occupied by youth. However, these units included dividing walls but had structural defects.</p>
          <p>Challenges identified</p>
          <p>The municipality was faced by the following challenges: . The fluctuating waiting list. . Funding challenges served as an obstacle to addressing housing needs in the municipality. . The sale of houses by beneficiaries.</p>
          <p>It was reiterated that the sale of houses, especially to foreign nationals, served as a major challenge to the municipality. In addition, some people were living in hazardous areas such as under Eskom power lines, as well as railway lines. Some of the completed units were illegally occupied by the youth in the area. Funding was also a challenge as R180 million was required to complete the top structure.</p>
          <p>It was reported that the missionary station in Saron required transformation, and was faced with water rights challenges. The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry was involved, but there had not been any progress at the time. The municipality required assistance with the acquisition of land in rural or farm wards. Additional assistance was needed from the Department of Land Affairs and Forestry in Simondium in order to fast-track the process. Thursday, 4 February 2010</p>
          <p>2.12 Meeting at Provincial Department of Housing and Local Government Offices</p>
          <p>The delegation was welcomed by a Councillor, Ms S Sims, who tendered an apology on behalf of the Mayor, Mr D Plato.</p>
          <p>The following key issues were identified:</p>
          <p>. The housing backlog in Cape Town was estimated at 475 000, while growth due to migration growth was estimated at 20 000 families per annum. Migratory trends were taken into account when funding was allocated at national level. . In most areas, units were of poor quality. However, quantity surveyors who authorised payments for work that did not meet the specified standards would be held liable. . The national Department of Human Settlements was requested to increase subsidies for informal settlements. . There was a need for the introduction of GAP market housing policy to address the issue of well-located land available for low-cost housing units. . The City of Cape Town acknowledged the need to address the plight backyard dwellers and to ensure that they had access to basic services.</p>
          <p>Deliberations by the delegation</p>
          <p>. Ms Dambuza expressed her appreciation for the spilt of the department (local government and housing) into two separate ones, since the there was a lack a focus on human settlements issues. . Funding was a critical issue. Parliament had recently enacted the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act which would allow for amending budgets. . While a commitment was made to eradicate informal settlements by 2014, it still remained a challenge. . Most policies overseen by Parliament were not tested for their implementability; thus an oversight visit was a suitable tool to evaluate implementation. . Complaints were received from families living in Makhaza about the lack of surrounding walls for toilets that negatively impacted on residents' sense of privacy and dignity. . Clarity was needed on the whether the upgrade project in Wallacedene was indeed a temporary relocation area, as well as what challenges were encountered. . Clarity was also required on whether any rectification programmes were being implemented in the province. . Additional information was needed on the response to backyard dwellers, as well as managing the beneficiary list.</p>
          <p>Responses from the City of Cape Town and the provincial Department</p>
          <p>The absence of toilet walls was an agreement between the City of Cape Town and the community of the Makhaza. Some toilets were already constructed in the area, but could not be completed due to inadequate funding. A total of 51 toilets remained uncovered, and the community agreed that it would construct these walls. In Wallacedene, the approach was an incremental developing of the area. Beneficiaries were allocated as 'double occupants' while their units were constructed. Densification was not considered an option, since beneficiaries resisted this proposal. People who resided on flood lines were also relocated to temporary relocation areas. However, since some of the residents returned to the site, members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) were deployed to protect the site. The City was in the process of engaging the banking sector to assist in financing GAP houses. For example, in Elsies River there was a project development set aside for GAP houses, which required repayment of a minimum of R1 300 per month. Neither the City nor the provincial Department was currently implementing a programme on rectification. Rectification was embarked upon when a group of people submitted their needs for rectification. The City applied for 15 houses in Du Noon, where residents had indicated that their units contained defects which required rectification. . (a) Site visit to Bardale Project</p>
          <p>The Bardale project constituted the upgrading of an informal settlement consisting of 5 947 units. There were serviced sites, which included water and sewer reticulation to each erf, as well as storm water drainage and tarred roads. The project was divided into phases, i.e.:</p>
          <p>Phase 1 was initiated during June 2005 with 1 912 units. Approximately 900 families from Khayelitsha and Mfuleni were housed. Phases 2 and 3 were constructed on an open land piece of land, hosting families originating from Mfuleni, Lwandle, Kosovo and Khayelitsha. Phases 4 and 5 would be placed on tender and were intended for construction during the latter part of 2010. It would also house families from surrounding areas, as well as the existing informal settlements of Mfuleni. . Phase 5 was expected to be finalised by July 2012.</p>
          <p>Challenges relating to the following were identified:</p>
          <p>. Relocating existing families to a temporary area, as well as to clear the site. . Convincing beneficiaries to move from adjacent areas such as Khayelitsha, Kosovo and Lwandle to Bardale in Mfuleni. . Unwillingness of the Mfuleni community to accept beneficiaries from other areas.</p>
          <p>(b) Site visit to Wallacedene (France)</p>
          <p>The delegation was informed that the project started as a managed PHP. Nomzabalazo was supporting the beneficiaries by supplying materials. The project was funded by the Irish government, and 40 m sized units were built. The delegation observed the following: the houses were not electrified and were without a bathroom or shower. Ceilings were falling apart. Structural defects were evident and doors were unstable.</p>
          <p>The delegation requested the municipality to follow up on the role played by Nomzabalazo and to verify what happened to the savings. The municipality would need to report back to the Committee.</p>
          <p>(c) Public meeting in Wallacedene (Kraaifontein)</p>
          <p>The delegation was joined by the Members of Parliament (MPs) for the constituency, as well as Members of Parliament in the Legislature (MPLs) deployed in the local parliamentary constituency office. It was indicated that councillors were not informed about the meeting on time, and as a result they could not organise their communities accordingly.</p>
          <p>The following issues were raised by members of the community:</p>
          <p>. Ward 7: Scottsdene houses were constructed in 1977, and since then there had been no further developments. The land was sold to affluent persons, while the poor did not qualify. . Phase 1 units in Bloekombos: houses were of poor quality. Roofs leaked when it rained. . Phase 4(b) plots were too small, and subsequently could not accommodate the construction of 40 m sized units. . During phases 1 and 2, about 10 000 backyard dwellers were promised houses, which to date had failed to materialise. . The community suggested that the municipality should construct houses on the land set aside for the racecourse, since the latter was not regarded as a priority. . Backyard dwellers were struggling to use inside the house toilets at night and were forced to use buckets. . Some tenants' backyard dwellers were exposed to unfair evictions by their landlords. . During December 2009, provincial and City representatives visited the area but could not address the community's concerns. Instead, the community was informed that due to budget constraints, no developments were planned for the area. . Government was not adhering to its black economic empowerment (BEE) policies. As such, building materials were often sourced from white- owned companies, while black-owned businesses remained unsupported. . People in informal settlements grouped themselves and joined a PHP project, which later disappeared. The project built poor quality units that were falling apart. . The process of transferring deeds was very slow, and the community subsequently requested intervention from the delegation. . A school was constructed some distance away from houses. This situation posed a safety risk since it was not safe for learners to cross roads by themselves. . Poor communication was regarded as a challenge, since the community was only informed the previous a day about the visit by the Portfolio Committee. . The community appealed to Parliament to assist and provide leadership where necessary in order to address their challenges, since they perceived housing delivery as slow and unfair.</p>
          <p>In response to the community, the following were issues were highlighted:</p>
          <p>There were about 32 000 families on the waiting list then for housing. This included about 15 000 families from informal settlements. However, with the current funding allocated, the City was only able to construct about 10 000 units per annum. A considerable portion of funding allocated to the City was utilised on the acquisition of land. The City had acquired two development corridors in proximity of the N1 and Blaauwberg area. At the time, there were no services available. Due to the shortage of land, the City was shifting its approach from single dwellings towards double or walk-up units. Funding to the value of R638 million would be dedicated to projects like PHP and CRUs, as well as the acquisition of land. In the informal settlement, the City was allocating services such as 1 to 5 families per toilet and 1 to 20 families for water supply. Due to the small plot size, it was initially decided that the units should be semi-detached. However, beneficiaries instead opted for narrow houses on single plots.</p>
          <p>Comments made by the delegation:</p>
          <p>Ms Dambuza reminded the meeting that Parliament was not an implementing agent. Instead, the province was the developer and the municipality was an implementing agent. The role of the Committee was to oversee whether appropriated funds were utilised efficiently and effectively, as well as monitor compliance with legislation (which included effective community participation). Ms Dambuza also raised a serious concern with the delegation's observation of litter at a nearby hall, while children played alongside it. She committed that the following concerns would be forwarded to the relevant departments for consideration:</p>
          <p>. Policies approved by government such as black economic empowerment and its implementation should be properly monitored in areas. . While government had committed itself to creating job opportunities, these were not forthcoming. . It is important that the different race groups integrate, since many of the amenities were utilised by certain groups. Those on the periphery remained marginalised. . The beneficiary waiting list was managed by officials and councillors. Since these arrangements proved to be unsatisfactory in some areas, the Committee would suggest a revision of this policy. To date, the national Department has already embarked on this process. . A policy aimed at backyard dwellers was critical, and in this regard community monitoring was important. . Public participation or involvement was not implemented properly. In this regard, it suggested a lack of transparency and fairness from both the province and City of Cape Town. . Acts of corruption by contractors through the selling of cement or sand was deemed unacceptable. Housing forums were needed to fight crime, or community structures needed to be established to serve as monitoring structures. . Emerging contractors should be considered, and local people should be given an opportunity to work with big contractors. Labour brokering should be monitored by the local municipality. . Funding was a national challenge. It was not sufficient for government alone to provide housing; instead it was the nation's responsibility. Municipalities needed to assist in building houses and also contributing to its own funding. . EIAs should be reviewed, since the process was too slow and resulted in delaying a project for about 2 to 3 years. . Municipalities need to build affordable houses for rental purposes intended for people those who did not qualify for government- subsidised houses. . The Housing Development Agency was tasked with acquiring affordable land to build houses, even though land needed to be utilised wisely.</p>
          <p>. The Scottsdene issue needed to be attended to urgently. Therefore, the City, and provincial and national departments should prioritise this issue and report to the Committee on real issues facing the community. If possible, a meeting between political principals could be convened.</p>
          <p>The City responded that 60% of the budget was spent on BEE empowerment. Furthermore, the City would consider the issue of land availability, especially the land set aside for a school in Wallacedene. However, the City requested the delegation's assistance with achieving its accreditation status.</p>
          <p>Friday, 5 February 2010</p>
          <p>2.13 Meeting at Provincial Department of Housing and Local Government offices - briefing on Community Residential Units At the time it was reported that a total of 7 700 units were in the process of being upgraded and refurbished. An occupation policy was developed to address the issue of unlawful occupation. The City had already approved the policy for the allocation of units. A caretaker would be appointed and tasked with general care of buildings, minor maintenance, as well as assist with the management of the building.</p>
          <p>The delegation sought clarity on the following:</p>
          <p>. The total amount of outstanding debt, allocation policy, as well as challenges in managing the beneficiary list. . An update on any future projects, especially in the Sea Point, Gugulethu and Khayelitsha areas. . The level of community participation, as well as the current policy in respect to purchasing or rental of units owned by the City. . Time frames for completion of relevant projects.</p>
          <p>The delegation was informed that the payment rate for rentals was 35%, which was very low considering that the outstanding debt totaled R4 million. The Debt Management Unit would request the indigent grant to assist in payment of the debt. An awareness and mobilisation campaign for qualifying people to apply was underway, and would be reviewed every six months.</p>
          <p>It was further stated that in Sea Point there were no rental units for the City. However, people were encouraged to register on a waiting list. There were South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) apartments that would be converted into rental stock. In Gugulethu and Khayelitsha there was no prioritisation, since the focus was only on 7 700 units. The community involvement was through political structures. The rent-to-buy option was would still be considered</p>
          <p>2.14 Briefing by Social Housing Company (SOHCO)</p>
          <p>SOHCO was a section 21 company. At the time of the visit it was busy constructing 450 units of phase 1 in Steenberg. In the second phase, it was going to construct 2 150 units. The company had a maintenance team on site, which included a caretaker. The company had installed solar geysers in each unit. Local labour was used during the construction process, which included women. The project was registered with the National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC). The delegation was informed that the social housing process went through a test on construction management of buildings, SOHCO, Communicare Property Development and Cape Town Community Housing Company.</p>
          <p>(a) Site visit to Kewtown Community Residential Units (CRUs)</p>
          <p>The project started on 18 January 2010, with 320 rental units comprising a total of 20 four-storey apartments. It was a refurbishment project by the City of Cape Town, which was approved during April 2009. The Kewtown CRU was the first project approved as part of a total of 11 CRU projects. Filcon, the contractor, was already on site, and the project was expected to be finalised by 18 November 2011.</p>
          <p>The beneficiaries would be relocated to 12 x 2.4 metre-sized converted containers, which included two bedrooms, a toilet and a bathroom. The sanitation facilities included full water borne sewer, a geyser and a kitchen system. The container was covered by material that was durable for habitation. Beneficiaries would be provided with other containers for furniture storage, while their units were being refurbished.</p>
          <p>Challenges</p>
          <p>The delegation was informed that property management would remain a challenge, especially in terms of rent collection and maintenance.</p>
          <p>(b) Site visit to Steenberg social housing project</p>
          <p>The project started in October 2008, and the site was still under construction. Phase 1 consisted of 450 units, which would be offered as rental housing for low-income households. Apartments varied between one, two and three bedroom units. Beneficiaries were expected to take up accommodation by March 2010, as 30 units would have been completed.</p>
          <p>Challenges</p>
          <p>The rainy season had delayed construction. The funding for Phase 2 would be a challenge, since was not listed within the Municipal Integrated Development Plan (IDP).</p>
          <p>2.15 Overall observations by the delegation</p>
          <p>The delegation observed a combination of good and bad practices. The following good practices were identified:</p>
          <p>. The separation of the provincial department of Human Settlements from Local Government to become a stand-alone department. . Some of the municipalities have demonstrated commitment and dedication in taking forward the human settlements programme. . In Plettenberg Bay the community showed appreciation, a sense of ownership and pride in their homes. . Good governance, as well as adequate implementation of the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) was evident in municipalities such as Laingsburg. . In Paarl significant progress had been made towards employing advanced technology innovations. . Improved quality of the product produced in the recent developments in municipalities such in Mossel Bay, Plettenberg Bay and Merweville in Beaufort West have been improved significantly. . The City of Cape Town displays commitment to upgrading of CRUs, as well as the rental units. . There is significant participation of emerging contractors in Knysna municipality.</p>
          <p>The challenges:</p>
          <p>. The majority of municipalities were not committed to the Farm Worker Assistance Programme as required by the National Housing Code. There was no specific programme to manage farm evictions. . Although funding provisions have been made to support the rectification programme, a lack of commitment by the province was observed. There are, in fact, quite a number of poor-quality houses, e.g. Mandlenkosi, Rustdene, and partly Hillside 1 in Beaufort West and Joe Slovo, Khayelitsha Ward 2 and Ward 12 in Mossel Bay. . The illegal occupation or invasion of houses occurred in the Paarl area. . In De Doorns privately-owned land was occupied by foreign nationals from Lesotho, which created an additional burden on municipal resources. The communities extended their shacks along river bank and flood lines and have no access to basic services, thus resulting in illegal connections and environmental degrading. . Lack of public participation in some municipalities. . Slow registration and handover of title deeds. . Reluctance of the province to provide basic services to forestry villages, e.g. Knysna. . Change in economic status of a beneficiary remained a critical challenge; hence the approval of subsidies took too long and therefore affected the beneficiary negatively. . Some municipalities have not benefited from the Enhanced Discount Benefit Scheme programme, e.g. Knysna. . Some municipalities have quite a number of serviced sites that have not been developed for a long time, e.g. in De Doorns with approximately 1 000 sites. . Most policies were not adhered to, such as the Housing Act of 1997, as amended, that prohibits beneficiaries to sell their houses before the period of eight years. . Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) hindered the delivery of houses as it took almost four years before they were approved. . The municipalities on the Garden Route were struggling to deliver houses as it was costly to build due to steepness of the land and forests. Those in the Karoo also struggled due to rocky surfaces and scarcity of water. . Scarcity of well-located land also hindered the delivery of houses. The Housing Development Agency was not yet visible or assisting. . In the province the ASLA contractor seemed to be receiving the majority of projects irrespective of reported unaccepted performance in most areas. It has been alleged that ASLA changed its name at various stages yet the board of directors was alleged to have remained the same. . Racial divides were repeatedly reported by the communities and the councillors in Mossel Bay, George and in Scottsdene. . The management and coordination of the beneficiary list remained a serious challenge.</p>
          <p>2.16 Recommendations by the delegation</p>
          <p>The delegation recommends that the national and the provincial Departments follow up, address the issues and report to the Committee on the following: . Compliance with the National Housing Code on Farm Workers Assistance Programme, including management of farm evictions in consultation with the respective department. . Rectification of old stock especially in Mandlenkosi, Rustdene, part of Hillside1, in Beaufort West and Joe Slovo, Khayelitsha Ward 2 and Ward 12 in Mossel Bay. . Report on the Enhanced Discount Benefit Scheme as most municipalities have not benefited. . Plans to enforce the Housing Act to prohibit the selling of subsidy houses in contravention of the Act. . Progress on Beneficiary List Management and Backyard Dwellers Policy. . Feedback on request made by the delegation on environmental impact assessment require political intervention, . A full report on land challenges (forestry village) in the Knysna Municipality should be forwarded to the Committee and the national department to follow -up, especially Transnet land. . A briefing by the Western Cape province on the issue of support supply to the People's Housing Process would be required. . Full report on the Scottsdene Self Help Project. . Housing Development Agency to report on and acquisition within the Province. . Compliance with equity and integration policies when allocating houses. . Enquiry and a full report on the allegations around ASLA. . Progress report on Debt Management of Community Residential Units. . Intensify public education and strengthened public involvement in all delivery programmes. . Enhanced capacity building of qualified local municipalities for the purpose of accelerating accreditation processes. . Mobilisation of funds to address the question of topography, hence the Municipal Infrastructure Grant did not address the above challenge. . Report on the plans in place and timeframes to develop 1 000 sites in De Doorns. . Report on the Izinyoka informal settlement's dispute in Mossel Bay around the removal of residents by the Municipality. . Joint Parliamentary Portfolio Committees should visit De Doorns to conduct a fact-finding mission where privately owned land had been occupied by foreign national from Lesotho. This created a burden on the municipality. As a result, the community extended its shacks to the river bank and flood lines and had no access to basic services, thus resulting in illegal connections and environmental degradation. . The Committee would visit respective deeds offices to oversee and ascertain challenges that hindered or delay process of Title Deeds Offices registration of the state subsidy houses. . The delegation was of the opinion that the contractors needed to be investigated and should pay back government funds.</p>
          <p>Recommendations with no stipulated timeframes should be carried out within four months after the publication of the report in the ATC.</p>
          <p>Report to be considered.</p>
