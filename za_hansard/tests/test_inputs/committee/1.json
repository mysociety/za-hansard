   "text": "Ms H Msweli (IFP) said that she was concerned that there were not enough inspectors, not only for labelling, but for the preservation of primary health in general. Prevention was better than cure and awareness and education had to be strengthened. Although monitoring had been identified as a challenge, there was nothing in the annexure which spoke to monitoring. She asked for information about the SALGA meeting held the previous day, to be shared. The Committee could not wait while people were suffering."

   "text": "Mr R Cebekhulu (IFP) commented that when he was at school, his teacher had told the students that South Africa was a dumping ground for first world countries. It seemed that officials and even commissioners became too relaxed after taking up office. Foreign countries scrutinised our exports, and citrus black spot and ostrich meat issues had negatively affected South Africa\u2019s food industry."

Unemployed people could be trained to follow a protocol to check on the basic concerns, after which the experts could follow up. She agreed that there were \u201ctoo many chiefs and not enough indians\u201d to look out for people on the ground. She encouraged consumer education to inform and empower consumers on a long term basis."
