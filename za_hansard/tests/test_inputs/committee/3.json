   "text": "Ms A Steyn (DA) agreed with Ms Nyalungu. Each bullet point said nothing. She asked why the issue of Ncera land, over which DAFF was custodian, would not be treated in isolation from other state land \u2018issues\u2019. She asked how many employees were implicated by the forensic report, how many employees in total were identified for disciplinary action, how many were currently working in state departments and in which department they were working; why there had been no disciplinary action taken against offenders to date and, if it had been taken, what disciplinary action had been taken. She then asked how long engagement about leases would continue and what was meant by: \u2018The leases (farmers) will be engaged on the modalities to take process forward amicably\u2019. She asked what was meant by: \u2018Meanwhile, the maintenance of all assets, including farm land, will be ensured as prescribed by the PFMA\u2019."

   "text": "Mr S Abrams (ANC) agreed with previous Members. The presentation lacked detail and the Committee could not accept such a presentation from the top echelons of the country. The Acting DG, who was the 7th DG, which included five acting DGs, was the recipient of a poisoned chalice. DAFF was alienating people on the ground and letting them down. Therefore, it was important that the credentials and background of the official who would be appointed was disclosed to the Committee. He asked for an explanation on what the \u2018other land issues\u2019 on the surrounding state land were. DAFF had made promises to Ncera communities since 2008 and yet had not re-visited them. DAFF had called on people to apply for land and therefore created expectations. Therefore, DAFF should be big enough to tell the people occupying land what exactly would be \u2018tedious\u2019 and how protracted the process would be and exactly how wide the implications would be. DAFF could not remove people from land, even if their lease had expired, after they had put sweat equity into the land. Ncera had failed because DAFF had failed to support it."

   "text": "Mr B Bhanga (COPE) commented that while DAFF should be the bread basket of the country, it appeared that DAFF had given up. The Committee had waited a month for a document - which said nothing. The Committee expected detail on how Ncera would be closed down. He suggested that the delegation should leave the meeting and submit a proper document with a chronological table of events for closing Ncera."

   "text": "Mr R Cebekhulu (IFP) commented that he was mourning for the people who were promised a better life. The Ncera entity was created and now its staff members would be re-deployed. He asked if the entity would be closed down completely and if not, who would manage it. It appeared that DAFF was aware of those who were responsible for misappropriation of funds, yet was shifting goal posts instead of taking action. He questioned whether what happened to the Ncera entity in the Eastern Cape would also happen to entities in other provinces. The community in the Eastern Cape had lost faith in DAFF."

   "personname": "N Phaliso", 
   "party": "ANC", 
   "text": "Ms N Phaliso (ANC) agreed with her colleagues. The violent conflict between the settler farmers and dwellers was the result of DAFF\u2019s lack of resolutions on restitution of land and also because of hunger. This was DAFF\u2019s administrative role. The Committee could not resolve those matters. She suggested naming and shaming the officials who had committed crime and asked for a report on who the officials were, how many of them were being investigated by the Hawks and how many of them DAFF would absorb."

   "text": "Ms M Pilusa-Mosoane (ANC) said that her colleagues had covered most of her comments. The Committee was made up of civil servants and could not teach DAFF how to do its work. Everything in the presentation referred to what DAFF \u2018would do\u2019, but it was spending government money to fly back and forth to Parliament after doing nothing for the South African people."

   "text": "The Chairperson concluded that the Committee expected DAFF to submit the Ncera (Pty) Ltd report in writing on the 20 July 2013 and then to present the report to the Committee on 13 August 2013. She asked Members for input on the draft progress report on Mechanisation before they undertook their upcoming oversight visits."
